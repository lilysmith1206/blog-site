That is, at the base level, what runes are. There are multiple different types, and I will do my best to go over all of them under this header.</p>\n<p>Runes must be engraved into the material with a chisel, or more generically, an etching tool. Runes must be on a single face on the glyph base.</p>\n<img src=\"images/IntakeRune.png\" alt=\"A metal desk with a slate chalkboard and chalk on it. The chalkboard has a funnel drawn, with lines going towards the bottom signifying the direction of essence flow.\" style=\"float: right;\">\n\n<h4>Intake Rune</h4>\n\n<p>The Intake Rune takes ambient essence and channels it. To allow it to take in ambient essence, the essence worker (esser) must complete the intake rune. In the image to the right, you can see the upside-down tripod with an arrow to where it should be positioned.</p>\n<p>When that is drawn in the correct place, the vertical line going off the bottom must be drawn to the last two lines coming off the side. The act of drawing that line is what allows the material to channel essence.</p>\n<p>Different materials have amounts of essence they can take in per second. Generally, the denser a material, the more essence they can withstand per second. This makes paper, chalkboards, and others poor choices, while metals are a better choice. Essence stone is the best choice.\n    <br>\n</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"clear: both;\">Refinement Runes</h4>\n\n<p>Refinement runes are runes that manipulate the essence flowing through the glyph without emitting it to a physical form. The types used in the story will likely be the following:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Filtering runes, to get one or more of the six alignments of essence and use them.</li>\n    <li>Capacitance runes, to store essence and release it in a burst to the next rune. The deeper the well for the rune, the more essence can be stored. If the well isn\'t deep enough, it may be ignored entirely due to the rate of essence flow.</li>\n    <li>Balancing runes. When a glyph is using multiple essence alignments (that don\'t destructively interfere with each other), it can be important to make sure both alignments are emitted at the proper time. This waits until all inputs have the same maximum amount of essence before letting all through. This can be harmful to the glyph if essence is left to sit in it.</li>\n    <li>Frequency runes, for adjusting luminous or acoustic aligned essence. These allow for specific tones or light frequencies to be emitted from the glyph.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 style=\"clear: both;\">Emission Runes</h4>\n\n<p>Emission Runes are runes that emit essence in a physical form. Emission runes can vary a lot.</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Bubble\" emission runes let essence seep out into a sphere around the glyph. Useful for saturating an area in essence. Impeded by solid material, but dissipates rather than inject itself into the material.&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>\"Touch\" emission runes require the face of the glyph to be positioned against an object. When it is, it sends the essence directly into whatever it\'s touching. Can be dangerous, as if it is not touching something the essence will continue to pool up in the glyph, but very useful for Torrid, Gelid, and Kinetic glyphs.</li>\n    <li>\"Directed\" emission runes shoot out the alignment in a specific direction, ideal for precision-based uses. Ex. focusing a beam of Luminous essence or a burst of Kinetic force.</li>\n    <li>\"Spray\" emission runes send the essence in a cone from the face of the glyph. Wider area of effect than directed emission runes.</li>\n    <li>\"Waste\" emission runes don\'t form the essence into anything physical, and simply dump it back out into the area. Useful for discarding alignments of essence that are not being used by the glyph. Normally would create an imbalance for alignments, but with the amount of essence around, it\'s practically impossible for that to occur.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 style=\"clear: both;\">Glyphs</h3>\n\n<p>Glyphs are a collection of runes, beginning with an intake rune, a series of refinement runes, and one or more emission rune. Well, technically, a glyph can just be a single intake rune, but that\'s not useful.</p>\n<p>An example glyph would be an intake rune, followed by a filtering rune for acoustic essence. That acoustic essence flows into a capacitance rune; this stores it up for a large burst. Then, it is led straight into a bubble emission rune, tuned to be the maximum size while still being audible.</p>\n<p>A glyph\'s runes are connected by channels across the glyph. Channels can connect across faces of the glyph\'s base.</p>\n<p>Runes and Channels cut into the surface of a material, usually a brick or thin rectangular prism. Different materials have different efficiencies for essence flow rate, as well as being able to handle the flow-rate of essence better. This is the only consideration for glyph base material.</p>\n<p>Glyphs are also incapable of being disabled once they begin channeling essence. The only thing that can temporarily suppress output of a glyph is an annihilative stealing essence in the surrounding area.</p>\n<p>This means that all magic done in this world must be prepared in advance. This is the main restriction of the magic system, along with needing to finish glyphs to activate them; you can only use the magic as long as you\'ve prepared it in advance.</p>\n<p>Finally, glyphs have a finite lifespan; essence is inherently corrosive to physical materials. Essence flow of any alignment(s) through a glyph results in the channels wearing away, the glyph base cracking, and eventually, structural issues so large the glyph cannot effectively channel essence anymore. An essence worker can determine how close a glyph is to rupturing through if the glyph is shaking and if there are any cracks appearing in the material.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>When that occurs, the glyph stops channeling essence. Depending on the alignment(s) of essence flowing through the glyph, different things can happen. A sudden burst of heat/cold, a mute void around the glyph, pieces of the glyph fracturing and flying away due to kinetic forces, sound emitting, etcetera.</p>\n<p>Most effects essence has through a glyph are completely opaque; an experienced esser can know what to look for, but in general, specific knowledge about essence work must be passed down from person to person.\n    <br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Essence</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine an ocean.</p>\n<p>The surface is placid, but its depths are mountainous. Valleys sink to depths, fighting for every inch of depth past the surface. There is no wildlife, no aquatic flora or fauna, as this is imagination, not an actual ocean.</p>\n<p>In the crushing depths at the bottom of the ocean, the essence presses against a seal holding it out of the physical world. The lower the depth, the harder it presses.</p>\n<p>In the matching physical location, an essence manipulator etches a line into a luminous-aligned glyph to light up the street during the night.</p>\n<p>The ocean shifts as the seal suddenly weakens, then loosens entirely; a circle has been cut out of the seal, and the pressure <em>forces</em> the essence through. It rockets into the intake rune on the glyph the essence manipulator lit, having its other alignments stripped through the luminous filtering glyph. It is then pushed out, effusing a warm glow from the safety of the lamp-post.</p>\n<p>The essence manipulator pushes her cart down the sidewalk to the next lamp.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>As described above, essence exists around the surface of Earth.</p>\n<p>Essence is pure in its ambient form, and can be filtered to one of the following alignments:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Gelid - Extracts heat from its area of effect. Forces cold and frost on whatever it is near. Cancels out Torrid if paired with it.</li>\n    <li>Torrid - Injects heat into the air and objects in its area of effect. The more essence through it, the higher the temperature. Cancels out Gelid.</li>\n    <li>Luminous - Creates light. The frequency of light varies depending on the emission rune used.</li>\n    <li>Acoustic - Creates sound waves. The frequency of these waves is dependent on the emission rune. Replications of natural sound is poorly understood. Mostly used for pure frequencies.</li>\n    <li>Kinetic - Creates force along a given vector, depending on emission rune. Harder on the rune base than other alignments, due to the forces involved.</li>\n    <li>Annihilative - Reduces most forms of energy to nothing, excluding temperature. Sound is quieted, light is dimmed, and essence is drawn in. Hardest of all alignments on the glyph base. Useful for suppressing the effects of other alignments.</li>\n    <li>Additionally, there is unaligned essence. Unaligned essence is functionally useless for most practical applications, as all alignments balance each other. Each alignment cancels out the others; Annihilative cancels out Kinetic, Acoustic, and Luminous, while Gelid and Torrid cancel each other out.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul></ul>\n<p>Alignments can be paired with other ones. When this is done, glyphs become much more complicated; they must route, convert, and emit each alignment separately.</p>\n<p>The only alignments that don\'t play nicely with others are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Gelid and Torrid - Cancels each other out. No visible effect, other than draining essence for nothing.</li>\n    <li>Annihilative and Anything - Annihilative suppresses the other alignment, making it, effectively, an Annihilative-only glyph</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The behavior of essence can be divided into two sections.</p>\n\n<h4>Before the Crisis</h4>\n\n<p>Essence drifted out of the ground at varying rates across the globe, forming a variety of essence dense areas across the United States. Glyphs (described later in detail) could be used to take in essence, converting it to physical effects on the world.</p>\n<p>Larger cities, generally, were more reliant on advances in technology rather than glyphwork. Even in areas where essence density was relatively high, it could be drained extremely quickly if glyphs were used in large force. The exception to the rule was coastal cities; essence permeated water a lot easier than solid ground, and so glyphs could be used much more before exhausting the essence saturating the area.</p>\n<p>Sankhurst, the only city the story of Runic will be focusing on, was a hotspot for glyphwork. Located on a peninsula and having groundwater under its soil, it became a prime place for glyph education, production, and selling.</p>\n<p>Because the replenishment of essence was at such a low rate, glyphs were less commonly used than regular technology due to reliability. However, they were still a prominent field of study and engineering.</p>\n\n<h4>The crisis</h4>\n\n<p>The essence crisis is an event of unknown cause that had a single, devastating result: flooding the air with a high amount of essence, relentlessly.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to the world before this, essence can impact the world physically. It just requires a high amount of essence density.</p>\n<p>Essence, at high density levels, punctures the layer preventing interaction between the physical world and the essence plane. This allows unaligned essence to torrent through to the physical plane. Without a material to course through, the unaligned essence loses all cohesion. It splits into each alignment, and each alignment hits the physical plane.</p>\n<p>Wild temperature variations, blinding light and radiation that kills long after you\'ve passed through it, zones of complete sensory deprivation, concussive explosives from nothing, and discordant sounds all come from zones where essence is in high density.</p>\n<p>As well, high-density essence zones can form chunks of stone called essence stone. These have an abnormally high rate of essence, and last very long in comparison to other materials. This makes them highly prioritized.</p>\n<p>This is what killed most populated areas. Their essence usage wasn\'t able to prevent this. The only cities that survived are the ones who already used glyphs to a high degree.</p>\n<p>Further details are restricted for spoiler reasons.</p>\n\n<h4>After the crisis</h4>\n\n<p>Post-crisis, Sankhurst focused on using essence in lieu of other solutions. This kept essence at a low density.</p>\n<p>People view essence work as a valuable job; it\'s why training for that is so highly prioritized. More details are available in the Sankhurst document.</p>\n<p>For any human population to survive effectively, they must draw on the essence to avoid living in an essence-ridden hellscape. Glyphs must constantly be used to avoid this; it\'s better to have individuals use their glyphs to help with the effort, rather than wasting precious resources on glyph structures to draw in essence and do nothing with it.</p>\n<p>In remote outposts, such as mining areas, they must stay indoors and draw on essence as much as possible to lessen the impacts. There\'s no real way to avoid it in an area out there; you just have to live with it.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>In this new post-essence density world, technology has taken a back-burner to glyph advancement. There\'s still some technological advancement, but due to the level of technology society is at after the crisis, it\'s very difficult to make progress on that. Most advanced tools are made using glyphs.\n    <br>\n</p>','2024-10-16 23:25:47'),

('mullvad','Switching from ExpressVPN to Mullvad VPN','8911e000-c2d5-43b8-b579-e748826ec131','2024-10-11 01:31:42','Switching to Mullvad from ExpressVPN','lylink, blog, content, posts, mullvad, expressvpn, switching vpns','Lylink\'s Blog - Switching to Mullvad','<h2 title=\"Sounds like an esoteric soft drink based on a show\">What even is Mullvad?</h2><p>Mullvad VPN is an independently owned Swedish VPN company that offers the most privacy I could find; only a single 16 digit number associated with your account, which you use to manage your account. It also allows payment in cash, which really speaks to its commitment to privacy, but I digress.</p><p>I previously used ExpressVPN, which I had some problems with; it cost around $10/mo, yet gave me a third of my usual internet speed (360 Mbps), caused issues relating to needing to authenticate that I was a person, failing to load online games, and caused a fair bit of hassle. I was hoping that Mullvad, being a relatively unknown VPN service, would mitigate a lot of those issues.</p><h2>Turning off ExpressVPN</h2><p>You want to know something? You\'re reading this article, so I assume so: the process to cancel most services in the modern age is not very easy. I couldn\'t \"cancel\" the membership, I could only \"disable automatic renewal.\" I couldn\'t even remove my credit card, only modify it, so if they decide to charge me anyway, it will not be fun. At least uninstalling the applications on the phone and PC were easy enough.</p><p>Sidenote: You ever wonder how much work goes into making it <em>just</em> hard enough to cancel a service, without making it downright impossible? There have to be so many meetings in the corporate world about the best way to do it. I mean, they\'ve gotta justify their jobs <em>somehow</em>, right? Gotta make the user experience worse... back on topic, though.</p><h2>Creating an account and installing Mullvad VPN</h2><p>Creating an account was as easy as getting the 16 digit number. No surprises during installation, which is great too. Their commitment to exposing privacy concerns was palpable in their payment portal as well; they explained that they used Stripe and linked to their privacy policy. It was very easy to sign into the application as well, just pasting in the 16-digit number and going forward. It felt very streamlined compared to ExpressVPN, with their email links and passwords.</p><p>For a later portion, I actually had to <em>reinstall</em> ExpressVPN, which really put into perspective how much easier it was to log in and turn on Mullvad VPN in comparison to ExpressVPN.</p><h2 title=\"Because that\'s all we really care about, right?\">Speedtest</h2><p>Below is a table of my internet speed measures when on no VPN, ExpressVPN, and Mullvad VPN. I took 4 measures on each one and averaged them out, so it shouldn\'t be down to the whims of a single errant issue.</p><p>All speeds are in megabits per second (Mbps).</p><table class=\"desktop\">    <thead>        <tr>            <th>VPN</th>            <th>First</th>            <th>Second</th>            <th>Third</th>            <th>Fourth</th>            <th>Average Speed</th>            <th>Slowest Response Time</th>        </tr>    </thead>    <tbody>        <tr>            <td>None</td>            <td>810</td>            <td>840</td>            <td>1100</td>            <td>1000</td>            <td>937.5</td>            <td>810</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>ExpressVPN</td>            <td>310</td>            <td>320</td>            <td>270</td>            <td>340</td>            <td>310</td>            <td>270</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>Mullvad VPN</td>            <td>540</td>            <td>840</td>            <td>920</td>            <td>670</td>            <td>742.5</td>            <td>540</td>        </tr>    </tbody></table><table class=\"mobile\">    <col span=\"1\" style=\"width:22%\">    <col span=\"1\" style=\"width:22%\">    <col span=\"1\" style=\"width:34%\">    <col span=\"1\" style=\"width:22%\">    <thead>        <tr>            <th>VPN</th>            <td>None</td>            <td>ExpressVPN</td>            <td>Mullvad</td>        </tr>    </thead>    <tbody>        <tr>            <th>First</th>            <td>810</td>            <td>310</td>            <td>540</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <th>Second</th>            <td>840</td>            <td>320</td>            <td>840</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <th>Third</th>            <td>1100</td>            <td>270</td>            <td>920</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <th>Fourth</th>            <td>1000</td>            <td>340</td>            <td>670</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <th>Average</th>            <td>937.5</td>            <td>310</td>            <td>742.5</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <th>Slowest</th>            <td>810</td>            <td>270</td>            <td>540</td>        </tr>    </tbody></table><p>Sidenote: While testing speeds, I got 77 Kbps through ExpressVPN. It did not seem like a rate-limiting issue by my IP because when testing by Mullvad VPN and an unsecured connection, I got similar results to what they had in the other trials. I have not included it in the table, because that seems like an unfair comparison against ExpressVPN\'s regular speeds. However, it is something to consider.</p><p>To me, this points to a very clear measure against ExpressVPN. While I do live in a fairly urban area, and the many people here may put more strain on the ExpressVPN infrastructure, ExpressVPN should be able to handle that large of a load. They have the income and infrastructure to do so, so I don\'t consider that a good reason for the apparent slowdown compared to Mullvad.</p><p>Even at the worst speeds I got off Mullvad VPN, it was still faster by 200 Mbps than ExpressVPN\'s highest speed. Which... uh, wow.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I did just switch to Mullvad VPN; however, it does seem to perform a fair sight better than ExpressVPN, even at its best. It does seem to fluctuate a bit, though, which is a cause for concern, but not something that overly concerns me. This gives me hope that it will perform consistently better than ExpressVPN even at its best, which is all I really wanted from a new VPN.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p>','2024-08-22 09:52:15'),

The dock isn\'t bustling at the moment; only a guy in a coat watching the private-for-hire area and a single boat, meaning most of her coworkers are chilling out with her manager.</p>\n<p>...who has a nasty expression on his face. How long was she staring at the box of rations before picking it up, exactly?</p>\n<p>He yells from across the docks. \"Get a move on, slowpoke! The ship won\'t load itself!\"</p>\n<p><em>God, even his badgering is unoriginal.</em> She starts towards the ship moored against the docks, hoisting the next box with her. If they\'d done any work, they\'d be done already and she could go home.</p>\n<p>Neddy was probably worried about her, the wonderful man. Though he usually was worried about her for one reason or another. It was \"You\'re bouncing around too much! You need to settle on something and get good at it before Municipal puts you somewhere you don\'t want to be!\" one day and \"You need to eat better!\" the next.</p>\n<p>If her brother hadn\'t taken care of her her whole life, she\'d think he was just a worrywart. With that, though, he was probably just succumbing to parental instincts.</p>\n<p>She stepped onto the boat\'s deck, the girl on board looking up from what she was hunched over when she did. Her eyes were focused into slits, but she opened up at seeing her with the box. A lazy wave came her way, but her attention shifted back onto whatever was in her lap before Geneviah could wave back.</p>\n<p>Like she had for the last few thousand trips on this damned boat, she awkwardly clambered for the cabin door\'s lever to open it, relief settling in her when it did. Geneviah hoisted the box into the bay under the trapdoor in the cabin, placing it with the others.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Her eyes swept the cramped space. <em>It\'s actually about three-fourths done, not halfway</em>. Her legs burned, and she took a deep breath. She could do this.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Relief flooded her aching arms as she climbed up, stopping halfway. Her line of sight was directly facing pants, not the metal wall of the cabin. Her eyes traveled up from the weathered pants to the angular face of the girl from the deck.</p>\n<p>She hadn\'t actually looked at her face that closely. She\'d been too focused on getting the damned job done so she could get off work, but... this girl was <em>pretty</em>. She made a frown look <em>good</em>, with her brows furrowed and arms crossed below her chest.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Ship girl\'s opened her mouth, paused, and then started again. \"Why are you working alone?\" Her voice was rough, deep. Geneviah\'d call it disuse, but each word was measured, not hesitant.</p>\n<p>\"My coworkers aren\'t pulling their weight. Believe me, I\'m going to the Docks rep after my shift.\" She said, clenching the ladder. \"You guys probably need whatever\'s in the boxes too, right? Someone\'s gotta do it.\"\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>The ship girl nodded. \"We do. But... you do know that you\'ve taken so long to load it that going to the Docks representative, talking to him for fifteen minutes, and bringing him back would\'ve taken less time than you\'ve spent interrupting me?\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah felt a flush creeping up her face. \"Look! I\'m not gonna leave a bunch of boxes on the dock. Sorry it\'s interrupting whatever -\" she punctuated the statement with a wave of her hand, taking it off the ladder to do so. \"- you\'re doing, but I\'d like to finish it up so I can report my terrible colleagues and even worse manager. Can I climb up now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" The girl\'s rough voice shot up in surprise. \"I didn\'t know I was blocking you. Sorry.\"</p>\n<p>As she stepped back, Geneviah scrambled up the ladder. Her hands flexed, trying to work out the cramps that had built up. \"Not a problem. I\'ll see you in a second when I go and grab another ration box.\"</p>\n<p>She waved behind her, hearing a low \"Yeah, sure.\" in response, before exiting the cabin and stepping off the deck and onto the dock.</p>\n<p>Geneviah stretched skyward, letting the last cramps ease out. <em>I don\'t care how ridiculous I look</em>.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>The sky was a brilliant blue, pinpointed with spots of complete darkness and brightness. The sun was shining high, directly above her. The city to the right of her was bustling at this time of day: some were in the factories, but weekends often had reduced hours. The cape was vast to her right: she knew it opened up into an ocean, but it looked so massive from where they were.</p>\n<p>The scale of the city and the ocean dwarfed her. Inadequacy crept through her, before she stamped it out with a vengeance. <em>Who\'s been the one who has worked through most of the boxes, huh? Who has keep at this job for the last forty five days while her coworkers goof off? Geneviah, that\'s who!</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>Actually, they aren\'t even goofing off! They just look bored, and one of them is napping! Instead of waking up her coworker, her manager was staring daggers at her because she had the audacity to stretch.</p>\n<p>Frustration boiled up. <em>I don\'t need this.</em> She abandoned picking up one of the boxes, and started stalking towards her fellow dockloaders-in-name-only, wishing she had sleeves so she could roll them up.</p>\n<p>She got halfway there before she heard lowered discussion from one of the private-for-hire stalls she was passing. Her gaze snapped to it: she was too nosy for her own good, honestly.</p>\n<p>It was the man from earlier who was watching the private-for-hire section. <em>I guess he picked someone.</em>, she mused. He had his hands on the stall\'s top and was leaning into it.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>She couldn\'t see his expression, but his tone of voice spelled it out perfectly. \"You\'re charging too much. My last contractor didn\'t quote a price nearly as harsh per trip, and he was on us for three trips before duty called.\" He was gruff, barely simmering frustration under his tone.</p>\n<p>The man he was speaking to: portly, a mustache with a shirt covered in some kind of purple powder. He had his hands held out, gesturing to the world. \"Then you\'re free to talk to anyone else here, sir. But I\'m the lowest rate you\'ll get, especially for something this urgent.\"</p>\n<p>Now, Geneviah could politely be described as impulsive.</p>\n<p>Some would call her impetuous to a fault, disregarding consequences in favor of short-team gratification. Thanks, Neddy.</p>\n<p>But Geneviah is, primarily, a creature of desire. She wants to experience it at all! It\'s why she\'s a dockloader, and was a message runner for the Commerce department before this, and a factory safety inspector before that.</p>\n<p>And this? This sounds <em>interesting</em>. This sounds like something she should get into before the true negotiations start.</p>\n<p>Before she totally agrees to it, her body commits, and she begins a casual walk towards the two men. The precursor to what\'s likely to be an explosive negotiation builds in volume as she trundles closer.</p>\n<p>\"Four hundred credits per trip? You\'re telling me no private esser in the entire docks can offer something better than that?\" His voice raised, attracting the attention of the other private-for-hires.</p>\n<p>Before she knew what she was doing, she spoke up, voice clear and carrying. \"Actually, I can do you better: one-hundred per trip.\"\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>The man in the coat whirled around, and she got a good look at his face and posture. Good thing she did, too: he was <em>not</em> happy. His expression was folded into disbelief, and he radiated tension. \"One hundred? Really?\"</p>\n<p>The man in the stall - for simplicity\'s sake in her head, she\'s just gonna call him Stall Guy - barked a laugh. \"Yeah, kid. You really willing to risk yourself for one hundred credits?\"</p>\n<p>She nodded. \"What? Not my fault you think you can\'t handle it.\"</p>\n<p>Stall Guy spluttered something about impudence in younger workers, and the Coat Guy looked at her closely. \"You sure you got what it takes? I need an essence worker of high skill.\"</p>\n<p><em>Aw, shit</em>. That\'s something Geneviah had been avoiding in her jobs. She got a working knowledge of it in her education, everyone did, but it had never clicked for her. She was no good with a chisel.</p>\n<p>She must\'ve hesitated a second too long, because doubt had crept into Coat Guy\'s expression, bleeding off some of the tension. \"I\'m surprised you asked, is all.\" <em>What am I doing?</em> \"I\'m very skilled with a chisel.\" <em>I\'m not!</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>Her internal panic must\'ve been very convincingly hidden, because Coat Guy bought it. \"Well, if you say so. Yours is the best offer I think I\'ll get; besides, just between you and me -\" he says, at normal volume. \"- I have a good Instinct about you.\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah recognised the emphasis on the Instinct, but couldn\'t place it. She saw Stall Guy bolt up from his chair behind the stall, and point to him. \"I didn\'t know you were Titled! I\'ll do fifty credits per trip, if you tell me how you got it!\"</p>\n<p>Titled. Geneviah felt a stone drop into her stomach: she had lied to a Titled individual. <em>Fuck.</em> Her skin felt cold, the weight of that one slip-up were pressing down on her. <em>Did he know? </em>She fought to keep her face from betraying her the flood of panic.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>This was bad. Geneviah could usually get away with hornswoggling any random individual for a job, just to find some new experience: anything she needed to know she could pick up on the job. But this? Titled peoples get respect that others don\'t. They deserve it, after all. They got Titled.</p>\n<p>Geneviah just committed a really, really harsh fuck-up: it\'s said that Titled people can always recognie a lie, but most just let it go. If they didn\'t? A way harsher punishment. They\'re very important people, after all. Nobody would ever lie to one for a potential job on a <em>whim</em>, would they?</p>\n<p>Geneviah kept her bravado plastered on her face, knowing he hadn\'t call her on his lie yet. Would he let her walk away? Could she pretend to not know him for the rest of her, likely tough, life? <em>Fat chance</em>.</p>\n<p>The Titled Coat Guy turned towards Stall Guy. \"Oh, now you\'re willing to work with me? No, I don\'t think so. I\'ve already chosen my essence worker. Thanks for the offer, though.\" He turned back around immediately after ending the sentence, coat swishing as he faced Geneviah.</p>\n<p>\"I can see you\'re in the middle of your shift. We can meet back at the docks: there\'s a caf<span class=\"BxUVEf ILfuVd\" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">é nearby </span></span>that I go to when I\'m on shore leave. We can discuss the job further there. It\'s the Commerce Caf<span class=\"BxUVEf ILfuVd\" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">é: you know it?\" He looked at her expectantly.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p>Her brain caught up, far too late with reality, that she should nod. She knew the Commerce Café. She knew it was beyond her price range. She nodded.</p>\n<p>Titled Coat Guy scratched his chin, and looked at her thoughtfully. \"Fantastic. At... seven sundown? We\'re setting off at ten sundown, so if you\'re committed, you should bring changes of clothes and toiletries.\"</p>\n<p>She nodded again. Clothes and toiletries. She\'d need to buy something to carry it in: Neddy\'d understand.</p>\n<p>\"I\'ll see you then.\" He said. Then, he walked off towards the ship. The ship that Geneviah had just been loading with rations.</p>\n<p><em>What the hell have I gotten myself into? </em>She fought the urge to bury her head in her hands. <em>I don\'t know the first thing about any of this.</em>\n\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\"I don\'t know what the hell you\'ve gotten yourself into.\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah put another shirt in her brand new carrying bag. She rolled her eyes, though Neddy can\'t see it from the entrance to her room. \"Neddy, I <em>know</em>. But I\'ve never worked for a Titled person before. At least, directly. This is something new!\"</p>\n<p>She grabbed some underwear off the floor and shoved it in. She heard his shoes hit the floor behind her, approaching. \"You\'ve done some things before, Genevie. And I\'ve put up with it for a while. But lying to a Titled man? That\'s beyond it.\"</p>\n<p>Her hands curled into fists and pressed against her clothes in the duffel bag. \"Yes, I <em>know</em>. Neddy, you\'re talking about this like I walked up to a man with a big sign saying \'I\'m Titled and can ruin your life if you mess with me!\'\"</p>\n<p>Pain shot up her arm from her palm, fingernails digging into it. \"I don\'t exactly know what else to do than meet him?! He saw my manager, and I spoke with one of his crew members! If I don\'t show, he\'s just gonna track me down for ditching him!\"</p>\n<p>A sigh. Then, she felt his arms close around her. \"I know. Just... promise you\'ll go there with the intent to turn it down?\" His voice turned conciliatory, and shame crept up her chest for snapping at him. <em>He just wants what\'s best for me.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>She shrugged herself out of his embrace and turned to face him. His expression... she wishes had done it sooner. His frown threatened to escape his face with the force of it, and stress was evident in every part of his face. \"I can\'t promise that, Neddy. I\'ve picked up work before: if the job is too good to turn down, me turning it down might arouse suspicion.\"</p>\n<p>Neddrick crossed his arms, and looked at her. Disappointment commingled with stress in his eyes. \"I know you. I\'ve seen you do this before, Geneviah. Every time you\'ve done it past, it\'s worked, but the worst you could\'ve gotten us there is a fine on our monthly credit allotment. This? This can get us kicked out Sankhurst entirely, and where are we gonna go?\"</p>\n<p>He gestured to the wall. Their apartment had no windows. Even if they did, it would just be concrete on the outside. Not a whole lot to see on a basement level.</p>\n<p>\"There\'s nothing out there besides the mining outposts. I don\'t fancy our chances. You need to say no to this man, I don\'t care what he offers you.\"</p>\n<p>With any luck, she\'d never be found out, so he was worrying over nothing. But he knew what was best. He had taken care of her for her whole life, as long as she could remember. When her mother was too busy running messages for the Municipal zone, he stepped up. But she couldn\'t get him in trouble due to her own bluffs and desire to see the new.</p>\n<p>A solution unfolded in her mind like a flower undergoing bloom, and her heart broke as she considered it.</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\" She said. Relief flickered across his face, and he opened his mouth as she paused. She cut him off. \"Kick me out, then. Go to Housing and say we got into a spat, but it was a personal thing.\" Relief turned to dismay. \"Make it known that you\'re not associated with me anymore. If I get found out, then you\'re fine. If I don\'t, I can come back.\"</p>\n<p>\"Genevie...\" He looked at war with himself. If she weren\'t telling him to essentially drop her from his life, she\'d find the journey his face was on funny. \"I can\'t do that. I won\'t.\"</p>\n<p>She spread her arms, chest hurting from the emotions rolling through her. \"Then I\'ll make it easy. I\'m going there to accept his offer of employment. Housing should be accepting visitors until six sundown, so you can roll over there while I finish packing. I\'ll be out of here by the time you get home.\"</p>\n<p>She blinked, tears trying to form in her eyes. \"And if they find out? It\'s not on you.\"</p>\n<p><em>Nothing\'s ever been this bad before</em>, she thought. <em>There\'s been a lot, but this takes the cake.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>He nodded. \"I can\'t have you here if you do this. I want you here, I need you in my life, but I can\'t support this. It\'s reckless, it\'s foolish, and you\'re gonna get yourself arrested.\"</p>\n<p>\"You don\'t know that, Neddy.\" She had to admit it was likely, internally, but she\'s picked up harder things on the job before.</p>\n<p>\"It\'s hard to know anything with you.\" He muttered. \"I\'m not gonna kick you out. If you still go ahead with this with me on the line, then that should weigh on your conscious. But you don\'t get to try and force me out of your life so you can destroy it.\"</p>\n<p>Silence settled like a heavy blanket, the kind people bankrupt themselves to buy when the cold sets in.</p>\n<p>Slowly, as though on auto-pilot, she began to start packing again. She had three arcs until seven sundown, and the docks were at least half an arc away.</p>\n<p>Neddrick frowned, then sighed. Then he left the room, letting the curtain that served as a privacy block between her room and the main room.</p>\n<p>The heavy silence wrapped around her, and all she could do was let out a shuddering breath.</p>\n<p>It\'d be alright. They would be. They\'d have to be.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Her duffel bag was hoisted over her shoulder as she stood outside the Commerce Café. The place looked just barely nicer than the other buildings, its bricks a little cleaner, a soft light coming through the open doorway.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>She and Neddy hadn\'t spoken before she had left. She\'d spotted him eating dinner at the table, but... she couldn\'t talk to him after what they had discussed. It would\'ve blown up again.</p>\n<p>She loved him, she truly did. But he didn\'t understand.</p>\n<p>She had to do this. She couldn\'t pass up on something this unique.</p>\n<p>With confidence in stride that she truly only slightly felt, she entered into the café.</p>\n<p>Now, Geneviah was no stranger to ritzier places. Her various bosses had taken her and her coworkers out to nicer places to celebrate some work goal or encourage team cohesion. She was always tenuously accepted at them: she was placed at her jobs with the express knowledge she\'d be leaving shortly after, and that didn\'t exactly endear her to her coworkers.</p>\n<p>This, though? This was a step above.</p>\n<p>It was a cozy entryway, with an exit into a hallway through an empty doorway. In an alcove to her right, leaning against the wall, was a man. Probably the doorkeeper, at a place like this. At her steps, he straightened up and looked at her. \"Hello, miss. Do you have a reservation?\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh...\" escaped her mouth. She didn\'t know this place took <em>reservations</em>. \"If I didn\'t, would I be able to go in anyway?\"</p>\n<p>He looked annoyed. \"No, ma\'am, you cannot. This is a private establishment for high-class citizens, and you both do not look or act the part. I\'m going to have to ask you to leave.\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah raised her hands. \"I\'m supposed to meet a Titled man here! I met him at the Docks earlier!\" Her words didn\'t slow the man\'s narrowing eyes and increasingly tense posture, like he expected a fight.</p>\n<p>Well, she\'d fight. Not just not like he expected. \"He said to meet me at seven sundown! Tell me you don\'t have a reservation for a Titled man at about five minutes ago for two, and I\'ll eat my hat.\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah was, notably, not wearing a hat. This line had caused enough befuddlement in the past to win the verbal spars she often got herself into.</p>\n<p>\"I\'m afraid I can\'t divulge our reservations list. Even if I could, why would that mean anything?\" He jabbed a finger at her. \"You probably just watched him walk in, anyway.\"</p>\n<p>Smugness ran its way through her. \"Ha! So he <em>did</em> get here just a bit ago! Go talk to him, or get someone else to. He\'s expecting me! Tell him the blonde dockloader who saved him credits for an experienced esser got here.\"</p>\n<p>The doorkeeper paused. He scratched his head, and then stepped out of the alcove while holding up a hand. \"Malorie! Can you talk to table seven? Ask him if he\'s expecting a dockloader.\"</p>\n<p>Murmured assent floated back into the entryway, and Geneviah stood in the entrance, foot tapping the ground. She had the song of the Flying Dixies flowing through her mind, a decently popular song the last time she attended a show.</p>\n<p>She got to the second verse - <em>Oh weep, for one has fallen. We all saw it coming, heard it in our hearts, maudlin.</em> - by the time a woman appeared in the entrance. She was shapely, nearly the exact opposite of Boat Girl. Where Boat Girl had been all angular: elbows, face, and expression, the servergirl was soft.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Hiram is awaiting a dockloader who also works as an essence worker. He said that,\" her eyes moved to Geneviah. \"she should keep that in mind in here.\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah smiled, fear hiding behind yet more bravado. \"As if I could ever forget.\" She turned her gaze back to the doorkeeper. \"I\'m good to enter then, Governor?\"</p>\n<p>He scowled. \"Yes. Have a pleasant meal, miss.\" He disappeared back into the alcove as he spoke, done with her.</p>\n<p>\"Lead the way, Malorie.\" Geneviah said, keeping that same smile. The servergirl nodded and led Geneviah through the right turn out of the entrance through a long hallway.</p>\n<p>\"Have you ever dined with the Commerce Café before, miss?\" Malorie asked. She could hear a hint of a smile in it, probably due to her clothes. She knew this place was fancy, but not \"turn away the poor\" fancy. <em>Didn\'t expect to have to wear one of my zero nice shirts or my zero dress pants...</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>\"No.\" was all she said. Anything more would\'ve given away the game: she was totally and completely out of her depth here.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>A beat and two doors - labeled three and four, respectively - passed by. \"Ah. Well, each reservation gets a special dining room. Yours, the seventh, is on the second floor of the building.\"</p>\n<p>\"That\'s nice.\" She plainly said. The walls were almost unnervingly well maintained, and as they walked along, she realised they were going up slightly: there were no stairs, but they were going up. Their footsteps echoed strangely around the silent hall, and a chill ran up her spine.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p><em>This building is so, so weird.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>Finally, they arrived at six and, to Geneviah\'s left, seven. Malorie turned around, and gave a little nod. \"I trust you can see yourself in. Hiram ordered ahead for you on drinks, but I\'ll be by shortly with those and our dinner options.\" She waited for a beat.</p>\n<p>Geneviah, belatedly, realised she had been waiting for a dismissal. \"Yeah, thanks. Appreciate it.\" With that, Malorie swiftly walked down the way they had just come.</p>\n<p>Before she entered, she took a deep breath. So what if the Commerce Café was wildly outside of her wheelhouse? What if her interacting with the Titled Coat Guy - Hiram, apparently - got her arrested because she lied to him? She would face it with a smile, and do her best to convince the Enforcers that Neddy had nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p>She pushed at the door - a heavy thing - and opened it to see the man from her afternoon sitting across a table from an empty seat. He still had on his coat, and his head had turned towards the door. A small smile broke across his face as he recognised her.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, good to see you. And with a duffel bag, too. I was worried you weren\'t going to accept. Come, come,\" he motioned to the chair across from him. \"Sit down. Malorie should be in with the drinks soon.\"</p>\n<p>She started forward, examining the room as she walked. \"Thanks, Hiram. Just realised I never introduced myself, I\'m Geneviah.\" The room was as cosy as the entryway to the café, with the only furniture being the table, the two chairs, and large window with a screen facing the street.</p>\n<p>Geneviah could see the sunset through it.</p>\n<p>\"Nice to meet you, Geneviah.\" He looked at her, and watched as she sat down. Then he continued. \"Let\'s talk about the job.\"</p>\n<p>She put her hands on the table and steepled her fingers. \"Yes, let\'s. So, you need an essence worker. I assume for your boat?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded. \"Yes. I don\'t know if you\'ve ever been on a boat.\" A pause, a chance to hop in and explain. Geneviah wasn\'t falling for that. She was in her element, negotiating with people. <em>Sure, it\'s higher stakes, but I\'ve done this loads of times.</em> \"Mine is propelled forward in the ocean by a series of kinetic propulsive glyphs that my current only long-time essence worker, Sae, makes.\"</p>\n<p>She nodded her agreement, like she knew what a kinetic propulsive glyph even was. \"And she\'s falling behind?\" <em>That\'s typically why someone hires a private worker, anyway</em>.</p>\n<p>He shook his head. \"To the contrary: she\'s done exceptionally well. That\'s my concern. She\'s overworking herself, and she\'s going to burn herself out on this trip or the next. I need you to relieve her workload a fair bit, and, if you can, get her to relax a little.\" He leaned back.</p>\n<p>Geneviah went to say, <em>Are you for real?</em> but the door opened. The shock of what she had been about to do hit her like a sledgehammer as the servergirl stepped forward to place their cups on the table. <em>For god\'s sakes, Geneviah, you cannot lose it right now.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>\"Water for the Titled Hiram, and a house specialty for the miss.\" Malorie said. She straightened up, and started speaking a clearly prepared menu.</p>\n<p>\"So, the house special for the night is a stew, slow cooked to perfection by our chefs. We also have our normal dishes: a broiled mushroom strips appetizer, crumbly and divine, our variety of salads with insect protein options, our soups, and finally, our baked frites as an accompaniment to any meal.\" She nods after finishing.</p>\n<p>Hiram simply responds with a request for the mushroom strips and the house special, and both gazes turn to Geneviah. Her breath quickens despite her control. <em>Have to remain calm. What did she say? Salads?</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>\"I\'ll take a cockraoch salad, please. No onions.\"</p>\n<p>That was... evidently the wrong thing to say. The servergirl\'s face endures a flash of shock, before snapping back to mild hospitality. \"Yes, that\'ll be the iceberg salad with cockroach as the protein, the mushroom strips, and the house stew. Anything else?\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah shakes her head, and Hiram does the same. Malorie leaves the room at fast pace. <em>Yeesh, that was not the way to order that here, apparently.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>She turned back to the Titled man she was lying to this fine evening, and saw him leaning forward across the table. A hint of levity graced his voice: \"You\'ve never eaten here before, have you?\"</p>\n<p>She shook her head. \"No, I haven\'t. This place is far, far, outside my budget. They barely even let me in the door.\" She shakes her head again. \"So, we were talking about the job.\"</p>\n<p>He raises a hand, leaning back into his chair. \"We will, we will. I don\'t want to hire someone I don\'t know. So, you don\'t usually eat here? Where do you?\"</p>\n<p><em>Well, shit.</em> \"Wherever\'s closest to where I\'m working. Either that or my brother packs me a lunch.\"</p>\n<p>He hummed thoughtfully. \"So you\'ve been a for-hire essence worker for multiple places? How many clients have you had?\"</p>\n<p><em>Aw, shit.</em> She gave a <em>hmm</em> of her own to buy her time. She didn\'t know any essence workers personally, especially ones that sold their services. At the Docks or otherwise.</p>\n<p>She started. \"Fi-\" and his eyebrow raised. <em>Shit</em>. \"-fteen. Fifteen clients in total over the last two years.\"</p>\n<p>He leaned forward. \"Any notable ones?\" <em>How am I supposed to know?! I haven\'t ever worked with glyphs?!</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>Fear churning, she scrambled for an answer. Essence knowledge, glyph knowledge...</p>\n<p>The only things she had ever seen essence being used for was artwork, like the sculpture in Municipal that got refreshed once and a while. Or... there was this one guy Neddrick worked with...</p>\n<p>\"Actually, I do have one you might find interesting.\" She propped her chin up on her hand, false confidence hiding the buzzing of her nerves. \"My brother introduced me to this artist: he wanted to create a series of glyphs that would cast light in different colors to create a multifaceted rainbow. It was pretty impressive, once the construction was finished.\"</p>\n<p>He nodded. \"So, how were you involved? Glyph artists can usually do their own art.\"</p>\n<p>She shook her head. \"This specific glyph artist...\" <em>did it all on his own, not including me, since I have no idea how to do glyphs</em> \"...just needed a set of extra hands. I did the glyphs in the green to purple range, and he did the glyphs from red to yellow.\"</p>\n<p>He nodded, again. \"How long did it take you?\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah felt like she was clawing at the walls of her own mind, trying to figure out literally any information on glyphs she had internalised. \"Four days, working night and day along with him in his place.\" <em>Please let that be close.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>The Titled man closed his eyes, internalizing that. She sat in tense silence as he seemingly drifted out of the conversation entirely.</p>\n<p>She chanced a glance out the window: the sun was dipping lower of the horizon. How long had she been here, half an hour? Three-quarters of a full hour?</p>\n<p>She returned to watching his face, only to see him watching her right back. \"I think you\'ll be perfect for the trip. It\'s four days out to our fishing spout, five back with the extra load. Can you spare that much time away from Sankhurst?\"</p>\n<p>She nodded, voice not betraying her hesitancy in the answer. \"My job as a dockloader was let go today after I stopped by the Docks representative after I finished with your boat\'s loading.\"</p>\n<p>Careful phrasing there on Geneviah\'s part did not reveal that she no longer had that job because she was, in fact, being blamed by her manager and coworkers for how slow the loading went. \"We tried to help her!\" is what they claimed, relayed by the representative. The bastards.</p>\n<p>The Titled man grinned. \"Then I think we have a deal. Welcome to the <em>Shanty</em>, Geneviah.\" The door begins to be pushed open, and he stops speaking to look towards it. \"Chow down. We\'ll be relying on the rations you gave us from here on out.\"</p>','2024-11-01 13:40:25'),

Her parents were stationed on an iron deposit\'s mine, and conceived her in the city proper. They were re-stationed on the mine, and Sae never heard from them since.</p>\n<p>She was taken in by the Runewright, a Titled essence worker who was on a shortlist Health keeps for prospective caretakers in situations like this. For the first eleven years of Sae\'s life, he was a good caretaker. A little strict, as some parents are, but she never worried beyond what the average kid worried about.</p>\n<p>Then, her surrogate father found he couldn\'t hold his hands straight when etching into the surface of a custom glyph order. <span class=\"illegible\">His customer base included individuals planning a revolt; his backing out would result in members of the revolt hurting him or Sae.</span>. His only choice was to ignore it.</p>\n<p>The Runewright was able to hide this issue for a year and a half before his quality began to suffer. His glyph quality slowly declined over When his customers threatened him over the loss in quality, he turned to Sae. She had been taking glyphwork lessons at his insistence, though she was in early days.</p>\n<p>He withdrew her from her current teacher and taught Sae himself, giving her an extremely narrow focus in what each client needed. She was twelve and a half at this point.</p>\n<p>This was enough to keep his customers, but pressure mounted on Sae. For her teenagehood, she was the main driver behind her caretaker\'s private glyphmaking business. Eventually, she was allowed a more thorough education in glyphs, essence, and runes.</p>\n<p>Aside from glyph etching practice, she was limited to only crafting the glyphs necessary for her surrogate father\'s client base. By the time she was fourteen, she was better than anyone her age for crafting glyphs. However, her studies were failing; her father\'s clientele required more and more glyphs, and for someone who isn\'t Titled, it was difficult.</p>\n<p>As a minor form of rebellion, she would etch her glyphs with a distinctive style, along with a signature on the back. S. N., for Sae Nove. This gave her some minor satisfaction, but the stress still mounted.</p>\n<p>This is when the Runewright, feeling his Title loosen around him since he wasn\'t etching glyphs anymore, merely coaching someone else, began to push Sae to be his successor as a Runewright. Simply passing on his Title didn\'t work; he concluded that Sae simply wasn\'t skilled enough with glyphmaking, and pushed her harder and harder.</p>\n<p>Sae internalised this heavily. She was trapped, suffocated by the constant demands of her from the Runewright, and their familial relationship completely collapsed. For the next three years, she was pushed relentlessly towards becoming the youngest Titled individual in recorded Sankhurst history.</p>\n<p>At seventeen, one last comment from the Runewright pushed her over the edge.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\"Sloppy.\" The Runewright spat. Sae watched from the corner of her eye as the Runewright clamped his hand around his mug. \"The client needs this kinetic glyph to draw in essence as fast as possible for its material.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir.\" She muttered. She couldn\'t fix it; can\'t put material back in the carved-out line. \"Should I restart with another brick?\"</p>\n<p>Disappointment emanated from his body. A frown crept across his face. \"The fact you even have to ask that is proof you\'re too far from ever getting a Title. Four years, Sae.\" He took a drink from the mug. Sae watched it shake, minutely, as it approached his mouth. He was holding something back, barely.</p>\n<p>Four years. The same disappointment, the same lack of care. No matter how well she did, there was always something. Half a decade\'s worth of resentment simmered in her gut.</p>\n<p>It was never going to be enough, was it? She wouldn\'t ever measure up to her guardian. Not in a way that he cared about.</p>\n<p>\"Are you really so surprised? You\'re only making a teenager do the work your business needs, I figured you were smart enough for that.\" A dark laugh fell out of her. \"I\'m about as unlikely as anyone else to find my way to a Title.\"</p>\n<p>She knew this wasn\'t helpful, but she just couldn\'t do it anymore. It had been six years of constant work. Nobody, Titled or not, could or should deal with this.</p>\n<p>At her words, his expression hardened. He stepped back as if struck. \"You can\'t be saying that, self-doubt isn\'t the way forward.\" He rubbed his hand against his leg, brows furrowing. Tension held his body straight, infecting his voice. \"Someone has to succeed me. I\'ve spent years building this. You think anyone else can do what I did? You think they wouldn\'t just let it all fall apart?\"</p>\n<p>Sae leapt up from her chair. \"You chose a child for this?! You could’ve hired an essence worker and let me have a normal childhood!\" A plaintive note crept into her voice, but she couldn\'t it.</p>\n<p>The Runewright — a funny Title for him, given he hadn\'t etched a glyph in years — glared at her. \"There are things you don\'t understand. Things I can\'t tell you, dangers you don\'t know about. That doesn\'t excuse your treatment of me.\"</p>\n<p>She felt her grip tighten around the glyph and the etching tool. She needed to breathe, but the anger wasn\'t letting her pull in a deep enough breath. \"My treatment of <em>you</em>? I\'m your <em>ward</em>!\"</p>\n<p>He shook his head. \"You have no idea. If you\'d just listen, I can explain—\" Sae interrupted him.</p>\n<p>A weight of exhaustion pressed into her chest, leaking out into something sharp and bitter. \"I don\'t <em>want</em> to understand! I\'m failing my classes! I haven\'t been out with my friends in years! Whatever danger is out there, it certainly doesn\'t need a seventeen year old to ward against it!\" Her entire body was shaking, frustration rolling through her chest.</p>\n<p>Her caretaker clenched his fists. Fear rocked her composure; he wouldn\'t hit her. He had been the worst father-type in the books, but he hadn\'t done that.</p>\n<p>\"I don\'t care what <em>you</em> want. You\'re needed, and you\'re going to fulfill that need, Sae.\" He scoffed. \"What exactly do you think is the end result here? You throw a childish tantrum of the demands placed on you by society and everything becomes better?\"</p>\n<p>The Runewright leaned towards her as if to jump at her. \"I can\'t etch glyphs anymore, Sae. You need to take up my responsibility. Someone has to.\"</p>\n<p>The combination of the clenched fists and the leaning forward hit some deep-buried instinct in her, and she hefted the brick she sloppily inscribed the kinetic rune onto. \"Don\'t take another step forward. You can\'t make me take up your responsibility.\"</p>\n<p>She didn\'t want to have to hit him, but his expression... the guardian she trusted was gone. All that remained was this man.</p>\n<p>A curt laugh snuck out of his mouth. \"Oh, yes, I can. You think the last few years have been rough? The work so far has been easy, Sae. They\'re going to eat you alive when you truly take over.\" He took another step forward, and Sae\'s body reacted without conscious thought. The rune-inscribed brick left her hand before she thought to hold onto it, frustration overwhelming her thought.</p>\n<p>As the solid brick smacked against his face, eyes widening in shock, she came to a realisation.</p>\n<p>Her rushed work had etched the intake rune fully, allowing essence to sneak in. It was poorly etched: the essence only came in at a trickle, but any amount was enough for the glyph to start working.</p>\n<p>The client wanted a glyph that could collapse a chunk of rock through force. Sae had etched a glyph that would shoot force out in several directions around the glyph... strong enough to punch through solid rock.</p>\n<p>She barely had the time to figure out what would happen in their mostly empty apartment before the glyph went off, shattering into pieces as lances of force shot out from it.</p>\n<p>If she was better at glyphwork, it wouldn\'t have been drawing in essence. Her guardian hadn\'t caught it because he was disappointed in her. Her breath would\'ve hitched, and fear would have curdled in her gut... if she had more than a second before the lances of force shot through the roof and walls behind her guardian.</p>\n<p>A terrifying groan echoed as the roof began to cave inwards.</p>\n<p>It seemed to collapse in slow motion. Her mind raced, body reacting too slowly. What could she do that wouldn\'t worsen the situation? Before she could take a single step, a piece of the roof hit the Runewright, causing a pained shout. It was all she heard before the rest of the collapsing roof blocked her view.</p>\n<p>The last thing she felt before darkness took her was the shame of failure.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>After Sae and the Runewright were taken from the wreckage of their apartment, the Runewright dismissed Sae from his care. The Captain, Hiram, agreed to take her upon discussing the matter with Health, and took her aboard the <em>Shanty</em>, his ship.</p>\n\n<h3>Geneviah</h3>\n\n<p>Geneviah was born to dysfunctional couple in Sankhurst.</p>\n<p>Her father was deemed incapable of caring for her, and moved to the mines once he refused to give up custody and became violent. Geneviah had forgotten what he looked like by the time she was six months old: she only grew up knowing her mother and older brother.</p>\n<p>Her mother was an errandwoman for the Sankhurst Municipal divisions, and spent most of her time running across the city to deliver messages. Her older brother, Neddrick, shortened to Neddy by Geneviah, took care of Geneviah as a young girl.</p>\n<p>Eventually, as she aged, she took on more and more of the household responsibilities until it was split between both her and her brother equally. Her mother, body struggling due to her work running across the city, was given a more comfortable position as a clerk for the Hydroponics department.</p>\n<p>Given this, she was able to be home more often, but a rift had grown between her kids and herself. They were still close, but they were both competent teenagers by this point.</p>\n<p>When Neddrick turned eighteen, he applied with Housing to take full-time care of Geneviah. Her mother fought this, but given her history of delegating care to Neddrick, he was defined as the primary caregiver for Geneviah.</p>\n<p>When Geneviah turned 17, becoming a full adult in Sankhurst\'s eyes, she decided to keep staying with him. They upgraded to a two-bedroom apartment as they were both adults.</p>\n<p>Geneviah herself bounces around from job to job for the last two years. She thrives on variety, and Commerce allows her this by shifting her assigned work designation. Her most recent venture is the docks, working as an unloader and loader for various supplies for ships leaving Sankhurst.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Geneviah cannot believe she is doing this.</p>\n<p>Her mouth moved faster than her regret, assenting with her ridiculous statement. \"Yeah, I\'m pretty good with glyphwork. These hands have etched <em>so</em> many glyphs.\" She flexed her hands in front of them, an oddly unsettling motion to her eyes.</p>\n<p><em>Too late to back out now! Going all-in on the \"bluffing to get new job I\'ve never had before\" train, I guess!</em>\n\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>The man - she had garnered he had come here to hire an essence worker, not much else - sighed. \"Kid—who are you again?\"</p>\n<p>She flashed a smile. \"Geneviah, your newest esser. You can call me Geneviah, though.\"</p>\n<p>Internally, while the man digested her name and appearance - not an unfair thing to do, given that she was dressed thinly for March - her brain screamed in panic.</p>\n<p><em>I\'ve never even </em>done<em> essence work in a professional setting! Only in the classrooms, and even then, I wasn\'t the best at it.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>I barely even </em>remember<em> the glyph alignments, for crying out loud.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>The man, whose name she really needed to ask for, turned to the essence worker for hire he had originally been talking to.</p>\n<p>\"Look, I don\'t really want to do this-\" He raised his hands in preparation for the shout from the private esser, but all he got was a choking sound. In Geneviah\'s mind, victory bells chimed.</p>\n<p>\"You cannot be serious! She walks up and spouts some crap, and you just drop me?\" The esser-for-hire\'s expression was <em>hilarious</em>.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>\"Look,\" he started, haltingly. Geneviah was resisting the urge to show any smugness on her face. \"She\'s got that feeling of knowing what she wants to do. And besides, I\'ve got this...\" he paused.</p>\n<p>\"Instinct, I suppose.\"</p>\n<p>That word caught in Geneviah’s mind. Her victorious feeling started to dim, replaced by cold disbelief as the man beside her bolted upright, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\"You\'re Titled?!\" He exclaimed, drawing the eye of every other private-for-hire in the surrounding stalls. \"Please, teach me. Tell me how you got there, I\'ve been trying for years...\"\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Geneviah\'s disbelief turned to ice in her veins. She placed it, now. This man was <em>Titled</em>? And he had fallen for her blustering? If she wasn\'t combing through her own shock, she\'d be begging for a Title in the same way.</p>\n<p>She didn\'t know what she\'d want a Title for, but they\'re <em>the</em> goal. Anyone who\'s anyone, like the Governor, has one.</p>\n<p>The man - the <em>Titled</em> man - shook his head. \"Desperation isn\'t a good look. Besides, I already said: I\'m taking the girl with me.\" He turned away from the man, who was still asking for tips on gaining a Title. \"I assume you need a minute to finish up your work?\"</p>\n<p>Another wave of shock hit her system: he had seen her working here? Why would he trust her blatant lie about her skills? \"Y-yes. Gotta finish up my shift before I take on any other work.\"</p>\n<p>The man nodded. \"Well, I\'m Hiram. You can call me the Captain, but I\'d prefer Hiram.\" He muttered something too low for Geneviah to catch before his eyes snapped back to attention.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Hiram clapped his hands. \"Well, I can tell you about that later. Tell you what: meet me back at my ship-\" he pointed to the ship Geneviah had been loading full of rations before she made this fool decision to get involved. \"- and I\'ll tell you the specifics. Bring a bag of clothes in case you do decide to go, we\'re leaving tonight.\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah could only nod. A Titled man, and she\'d be stuck with him for the duration of the job. Probably on the ocean. She had done some wild things for new experiences: not including breaking into the Hydroponics department to retrieve her sleeping-on-the-job mother, but... this took the cake for her.</p>\n<p>Hiram clapped a hand on her shoulder. \"Sounds good! I\'ll see you after your shift, then.\"</p>\n<p>Geneviah could only watch as he walked back to the boat, dark blue coat waving behind him. What had she gotten herself into?</p>\n<p>Still, she couldn\'t help but let a slight grin form on her face. She had to warn Neddy she\'d be gone for a while: couldn\'t pass up on this.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>From this, she was able to join up with Sae on the <em>Shanty</em>. The Captain didn\'t believe her about her skills, but his Title did tell her she\'d be useful for the trip. He also believed she could be a good help with Sae\'s hard exterior, who was on the boat Geneviah was working on.</p>\n<p>Geneviah is, primarily, scheming. She\'s happy-go-lucky, ready to go with the flow, but also a hedonistic person: she wants to experience everything the world has to offer with the people she cares about, and currently, that\'s only Neddrick.</p>\n\n<h3>Hiram, the Captain</h3>\n\n<p>Hiram\'s childhood will not be explored in Runic.</p>\n<p>We start in his late 20s. He\'s a deckhand for the vessel <em>Shanty</em>, a fishing boat. He manages two roles: glyph replacement and piloting the ship when the captain of the vessel was sleeping or otherwise indisposed. The <em>Shanty</em> had a single esser at the time, and a great burden was placed on this esser.</p>\n<p>One day during a routine trip, after gathering fish from one of their spots, they passed through an essence-rich area. The essence was so dense that it started impeding reality; kinetic force was shot through the ocean, sending pillars of water up into the air. Small whirlpools were formed due to gelid and torrid essence, sending the ocean into a frothing frenzy.</p>\n<p>The captain of the vessel had never experienced this before, and panicked.</p>\n<p>He went out to see if the esser was okay, leaving Hiram on the wheel, when annihilative essence burst into reality, darkening the entire ship and blotting out both light and communication.</p>\n<p>While the annihilative essence subsumed the ship, the ship was tossed over a wave, and plummeted into the ocean\'s surface, knocking the entire cabin around.</p>\n<p>When it cleared, Hiram was the only one left on the <em>Shanty</em>. He came into his Title then, meditative and calm due to the shock of losing both his captain and his esser.</p>\n<p>He was able to navigate the ship back to shore, skating by on nearly running out of glyphs, and only discovered later that he was Titled; he hadn\'t even noticed in the calamity.</p>\n<p>Hiram was awarded the ship <em>Shanty</em> for his efforts in bringing it back, and offered to continue his old captain\'s job.</p>\n<p>The Captain accepted.</p>\n<p>Ever since then, he\'s had two essers on board, both of which is trained in steering the boat. He also modified the front of the ship to be a sleeping area, with dense enough cover to avoid essence penetration in the same way the cabin avoids it.</p>\n<p>When Sae was seventeen and he thirty-one, he took her on board as a constant esser. She\'s learned a lot from him; he views her as his own kid, a wayward teen. He will never tell her that, though; Hiram is a moderately reserved man around Sae, careful to avoid triggering any remaining issues with the Runewright\'s treatment of her.</p>\n<p>When she first came aboard, he had to let her tire herself out trying to prove herself.

Seriously!</h2>\n\n<p>It\'s been minor in other documents, but this is the plot!</p>\n<p>Do not read if you want to experience the book without spoilers!</p>\n\n<h3>The <em>Passage</em> Arc</h3>\n\n\n<h4>PASSAGE</h4>\n\n<p>The arc starts with the a stinger. It\'s from when Geneviah falls into the ocean at during Swells: in italics, a reference to the cold, crushing embrace of water. The story starts on the 45th day she\'s been working as a dockloader, and she\'s sick of it. When she spots the chance to jump ship and find a new job from a private hirer, she goes for it. She bluffs her way into being taken serously, only to realize she was hired on by someone Titled, and that she\'s jumped into something way above her skill level. The Captain leaves her to finish her shift shell-shocked.</p>\n<p>She finishes her shift and goes back home, swinging through the commercial district to pick up a duffel bag, to pack up her clothes. Her brother Neddrick quizzes her, then implores her not to take the job. She refuses, citing a new experience that she\'ll never get again if she doesn\'t take it now, and then leaves with a bag full of clothes along with toiletries.</p>\n<p>She meets the Captain on the docks, and he motions her over to a cafe. They both eat dinner as he explains the job: a single round-trip on the ocean, to a fishing spot. Her job will be to maintain the glyphs Sae is producing, and learn from her. When Geneviah expresses surprise he realized she didn\'t have the glyphwork skills necessary, he gives her a look so pitying it makes her shut up. Geneviah agrees to the job, and she and the Captain leave for the <em>Shanty</em>.</p>\n\n<h4>UNDERTOW</h4>\n\n<p>Maiden Voyage centers on Sae\'s perspective: she\'s focused on etching a glyph, trying to sink into the deep, meditative status she\'s been told is the key to unlocking a Title. She is repeatedly interrupted by the dockworkers.</p>\n<p>We get a bit of exposition on glyphs and essence: Sae ruminates on it as she etches, interspersed with interruptions preventing us from getting too deep into it.</p>\n<p>After the fifth interruption, walking towards the boat, Sae finally leans over the gets ready to throw the glyph she\'s etching at whoever is walking down. It turns out to be the Captain and Geneviah. Sae is distrustful; she heard the commotion at the dock earlier, and knows the Captain\'s status as Titled likely attracted people who wouldn\'t normally be interested. She intends to have a conversation with the Captain, but is distracted by Geneviah.</p>\n<p>Sexuality isn\'t repressed in Sankhurst, but it\'s moderately uncommon. Sae feels a connection with Geneviah immediately, but tamps down on it hard. She introduces herself politely, and asks the Captain if they can have a discussion in the cabin before they set off.</p>\n<p>Geneviah asks the Captain what she should do in the intermediary. Sae interrupts, and asks her to check out the glyph she was etching and correct it as much as she can so she knows where Geneviah\'s skill level is at. Sae exposits here that the Captain often hires essers in addition to Sae. Internally, she feels as though this limits her potential.</p>\n<p>Sae and the Captain discuss the new girl in-depth: the Captain relates what he noticed over dinner, and tells Sae to keep an eye on her. Then, they both notice her walking in front of the cabin\'s window on the front of the ship. The chapter ends with Sae opening the door to check on her.\n    <br>\n</p>\n\n<h4>MAIDEN VOYAGE</h4>\n\n<p>Back to Geneviah\'s perspective. Set just after Sae and the Captain go into the cabin, she tries desperately to remember anything. Give a flashback of classroom learning experience: have it warble in and out as she loses the memory.</p>\n<p>Eventually, have the idea strike her to check around the deck. If she\'s gonna fail it, she might as well check out the deck instead of wasting time. She traipses along the back of the boat, noting the leather straps. She finds a box of glyphs, and notes that they look nearly like the one she was handed. Inside is an etching tool, and she tries her best to get the glyph approximating the other ones.</p>\n<p>After she gives up on improving the glyph any further, she walks around the rest of the ship. She pokes her head into the sleeping quarters on the front of the ship. At this point, Sae calls out to her from the back of the ship, and she startles and runs back there.</p>\n<p>They converse for a bit about the glyph: Sae notes that Geneviah managed to get the glyph to a good spot, even if she couldn\'t fix it entirely. She admits that there really wasn\'t a way to get it back to good form; she\'ll have to start from the back, and it won\'t be nearly as stable due to that. Geneviah agrees. Sae offers to take the first shift of the setting up the glyphs, and Geneviah accepts, going to sleep. She finds her bedroll (actually Sae\'s), and falls asleep.</p>\n\n<h4>DRIFT</h4>\n\n<p>Sae muses to herself during the first shift about Geneviah. She decides to go to the front of the ship and wake her after her three-hour shift, leaving Sae alone with her thoughts for the majority of it.</p>\n<p>We get a bit of exposition here about the ship, Sae\'s place on it, and how Geneviah feels different from the other private-for-hire essers that the Captain has hired. We also get a bit of exposition about Titles: Sae makes an off-hand remark about how Geneviah, like all the other essers, are probably just here to glean some information about a Title. She makes a disparaging comment about how she couldn\'t do it for two years, so them thinking they can do it in one or two trips is crazy.</p>\n<p>The shift passes by in a blur as she muses, replacing glyphs and etching more using essence stone. Eventually, after Sae judges three hours to have passed via the sun, she stands up, and tells the Captain. He remarks that she should stick with Geneviah so she knows how to work her shift: Sae agrees, but only for an hour. She needs some rest.</p>\n<p>She goes to wake Geneviah up, who is bleary. Sae has no patience for it, having done this multiple times with other essers. Geneviah eventually wakes up fully, and they make their way to go the back of the ship for their shift.</p>\n\n<h4>AWASH</h4>\n\n<p>Geneviah\'s perspective again. Outwardly, she\'s projecting ease, but she is SO STRESSED OUT internally. Like, oh my god, she has no idea how to do this work, and Sae is just looking at her? Scarily?</p>\n<p>Geneviah remembers some information about glyphs when they\'re close to shattering: essence of the alignments flowing through the glyph start to leak out. In this case, kinetic glyphs tend to shake and move around when they\'re close to shattering. She examines the glyphs and says none of them seem close to shattering. She stops herself from going on: someone experienced doesn\'t need to justify their own thoughts, they just have them.</p>\n<p>Sae agrees, and they sit down for a bit. Geneviah watches the sea next to them; she can see essence leakage. Go into detail, here: it wasn\'t important to Sae because she\'s out here all the time, but for Geneviah it\'s a major sight. Talk about the oceans churning due to the kinetic force, shimmering in the air and ice chunks floating in the ocean. Note also the formation of essence stone. Geneviah is lucky enough to see it, and they talk about it for a bit.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Sae notices one of the glyphs approaching early stages of shattering. She instructs Geneviah on replacing it, handing her the etching tool so she can finish off the glyph. She does so.</p>\n<p>The two sit back for the rest of the shift. Geneviah remarks that it only feels like it\'s been ten minutes, not an hour. Sae asks, incredulously, if Geneviah doesn\'t know how to measure time. She shrugs, saying exact timing hasn\'t ever been that important for her. She usually errs on being early rather than late. Sae responds that she has to know how to tell time via the sky, and begins instructing her.</p>\n\n<h4>FISHING</h4>\n\n<p>Sae\'s perspective. The <em>Shanty</em> arrives at the fishing spot. Sae instructs Geneviah on using less powerful kinetic glyphs to allow the boat to trawl along the ocean and collect fish, as the Captain gets the net ready.</p>\n<p>As it trawls, Sae hunches over a glyph and begins to chisel it. She\'s trying to make a heating rune for the cabin; the Captain ran out, and Sae forgot to replenish it. She beats herself up mentally over it. Geneviah comes over and asks Sae about the rune she\'s etching: a filtering rune. Sae tells her it\'s for filtering the essence alignments out, and at Geneviah\'s prodding, goes more into detail. Geneviah and the audience gets an overview of essence alignments. Sae grows more and more animated, and leans close to Geneviah\'s face.</p>\n<p>Hiram announces trawling has finished, and Geneviah and Sae scramble to do the work. They don\'t talk about what happened.</p>\n<p>The Captain gets a terrible, churning feeling in his chest while they\'re bringing the catch up. He tells Sae, in very terse words, to get inside the cabin along with Geneviah. He\'ll be in shortly. He needs to figure out why his Title feels as though the ocean is a terrible, terrible place to be right now.</p>\n\n<h4>BURST</h4>\n\n<p>Sae and Geneviah are in the cabin. Geneviah\'s perspective: she\'s freaking out, she didn\'t think she\'d die out here. Sae walks her through one of the breathing exercises the Captain taught her; find five-four-three-two-one things.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Captain opens the door and steps through. He says that he can see how dense the essence is around the ship through its effects on the world; outside a small range on the ship due to the glyphs they have puttering them forward, it\'s a kaleidoscope of nothingness, sprays of water, and bright flashes.</p>\n<p>Geneviah asks what they should do. The Captain says that he has, once, and he\'s not going to let the same thing happen. He says that Sae needs to begin carving burner glyphs to draw on as much essence as possible around the ship to avoid the essence density from crashing onto the ship as well.</p>\n<p>Sae directs Geneviah, who is confused at the idea of a burner glyph, to etch into some emergency glyph bases. The burner glyph is simple: an absorption glyph, carved to take in as much essence as possible. They then toss it somewhere it won\'t interfere with their vision.</p>\n<p>The two begin etching.\n    <br>\n</p>\n\n<h4>WAVES</h4>\n\n<p>Sae\'s perspective.</p>\n<p>Geneviah and Sae are on their fifth glyph; the Captain is sitting back and meditating, trying to determine if they have a shot of getting out.</p>\n<p>Sae is extremely focused on glyphmaking, trying to sink deep into meditating. She can\'t feel a whiff of it, and it\'s frustrating due to her past experience with her search for a Title.</p>\n<p>Her glyphwork falters, and the stress of it all crashes on her at once. A choked sob exits her throat, and Geneviah tries to do the exercise she showed her last chapter, but it doesn\'t help. The Captain is still deep in meditation, so Sae feels arms wrap around her as she cries.</p>\n<p>She blubbers that she just cannot seem to get the hang of a Title: she\'s tried for ages, and can\'t seem to ever get it. Even in a situation like this, where they\'re closer to death than she\'s ever been, she still can\'t get a grip on the Title.</p>\n<p>Geneviah gives her encouraging words, and tells her that she\'s never once felt like Sae isn\'t knowledgeable due to a lack of a Title: just look at how much she\'s learned while talking to her!</p>\n<p>This calms Sae down enough to ask what Geneviah\'s learned. The answer? Basically everything.</p>\n<p>Sae has shocked horror that Geneviah not only didn\'t know anything, she tricked the Captain into letting her on board in spite of that.</p>\n\n<h4>SURFACE</h4>\n\n<p>Geneviah\'s perspective.</p>\n<p>Sae pushes Geneviah away, and she hits the back wall of the cabin. The Captain wakes up at the noise, and asks what the hell happened. Sae exclaims that Geneviah is a fraud, and that she\'s not actually an essence worker, and that she\'s <em>really</em> here to just learn how to get a Title.</p>\n<p>Geneviah is appalled, and can\'t articulate a defense. Somehow, \"I lied to have fun\" is worse than \"I lied to get your boss to tell me how to get a Title\". The Captain responds with an emphatic \"No\", that Sae has it wrong: he knew Geneviah was a liar from the moment she opened her mouth.</p>\n<p>Geneviah and Sae are both shocked into silence. Geneviah manages to eke out a \"...why hire me, then?\", and the Captain responds with a story:</p>\n<p>Sae has been struggling. It\'s obvious she needs a friend, but the private essers-for-hire can\'t cut it in the regular essence employment: Sae would just turn them down immediately. She doesn\'t spend long enough on shore leave to make friends with anyone.</p>\n<p>Geneviah pipes up and asks why the hell she needed to make friends? Classes in Sankhurst are extremely close; she should have a bunch of people to meet her on shore leave.</p>\n<p>Sae\'s face turns dark, and she curls up on herself. The Captain tells Geneviah that that story is for Sae to tell, not him, but suffice to say, he just wanted a friend for Sae. Geneviah fit the bill, and if she had the gall to lie to him to go on the sea, she has the gall to learn as she goes. If she failed to learn, she\'d just be kicked out.</p>\n<p>Geneviah and Sae sit with the realization, before Geneviah gets up and walks over to Sae. She tells her that she\'s sorry, she just wanted to experience something new outside of Sankhurst. But if Sae is willing, they can restart their relationship fresh, without any sneakiness.</p>\n<p>Sae doesn\'t respond for a minute, making Geneviah nervous, but eventually she grasps the offered hand and accepts.</p>\n\n<h4>CROSSCURRENT</h4>\n\n<p>Sae\'s perspective. She wakes up in the sleeping compartment of the <em>Shanty</em>, and reviews what happened yesterday in her mind. The Captain dismissed them after a few more hours of tense silence between Sae and Geneviah, keeping up the supply of burner glyphs to make sure the essence storm wouldn\'t interact with them.</p>\n<p>She opens her eyes to see Geneviah still asleep next to her. A variety of feelings flow through her: betrayal, but also hope. She has genuinely grown to like Geneviah over the last few days, but being lied to is a hurt that won\'t heal any time soon. She mentally packs her feelings away in boxes and leaves the sleeping compartment, having a close call with waking Geneviah up.</p>\n<p>She goes to speak with the Captain: he\'s awake and meditating in the cabin. He notices her after she clears his throat, and stands up to hug her. Sae flinches a bit and he stops, hurt but understanding. He tells her that he didn\'t intend to hurt her: he understands if it takes time to forgive him. Sae says she already has, but it\'ll take time to internalize. He nods. She asks when they\'re setting out. \"Right now\", he says.</p>\n<p>Sae sets up the glyphs while reflecting on Geneviah\'s betrayal further. Hints of her backstory appear here with the Runewright: betrayal by people she cares about is something that hurts a lot worse for her than others.</p>\n<p>However, she decides that she can teach Geneviah. It might be a new path to a Title, and she enjoys talking about glyphwork regardless. Maybe, once they go out on shore leave, they can go out and do what normal young people do.</p>\n<p>The chapter ends with that: the boat setting off as Sae settles into a resolution.</p>\n\n<h4>BEARINGS</h4>\n<h4>\n<p>Geneviah\'s perspective. She wakes up to the Captain speaking with her, wrinkling his nose at the smell of anxious sweat in the sleeping compartment. Geneviah smiles apologetically at him, and he moves on. He wants Geneviah to take over for Sae shortly, and grab some rations from the storage compartment below the cabin. Geneviah assents, and he nods. He says that her lack of experience isn\'t an excuse to do any less than Sae: he expects her to work just as hard, and harder to catch up. Geneviah agrees, and says that she already made that commitment when she joined. That\'s what she\'s been doing all her life since she became old enough to work.</p>\n<p>She follows the Captain out of the sleeping compartment, seeing Sae on the back of the ship staring off into the water at the pockets of essence density causing interesting visuals. Geneviah and the Captain go into the cabin, him settling on the wheel and Geneviah opening a trapdoor in the cabin to the storage compartment. In there, she creates two rations from the food they were given: she decides on a few legs of meat and a side of tomatoes and broccoli. She closes the boxes afterwards, feeling the chill from the glyphs inside permeate the box to keep it fresh.</p>\n<p>She carries both plates with lids up into the cabin, and out to Sae. Sae quickly etches a pretty bad torrid glyph for heating up the meat, and they both eat. It\'s a nice moment for Geneviah, feeling almost normal after the events of WAVES.</p>\n<p>Sae tells Geneviah that she wants to teach her about essence and glyphwork. It\'s important to her that whoever she works with has a working knowledge of glyphs. Geneviah objects, saying she has at least a <em>basic</em> knowledge, but after Sae asks her what the six alignments are, what emission versus refinement runes do, and why what happened last night happened, Geneviah falls quiet.</p>\n<p>Sae must notice Geneviah\'s expression of discontent, because she follows up with \"Don\'t worry, I\'ll teach you. You\'ll come out of this trip knowing at least a little about glyphs.\"</p>\n<p>All Geneviah can feel is relief that she isn\'t going to be punished for lying to a Titled person, and that she isn\'t going to be stuck working with someone who hates her. As well, she doesn\'t have to trick Sae into telling her about essence now.</p>\n<p>It ends with a line. \"Thank god. She can finally learn about things like a normal person.\"</p>\n\n</h4>\n<h4>INLET</h4>\n\n<p>Sae\'s perspective.</p>\n<p>Geneviah takes over watching the glyphs, and Sae starts giving her an introduction to essence work. She asks a series of preliminary questions: do you know what essence is? How do glyphs work? What are runes?</p>\n<p>When Geneviah gives basic information for every question, and doesn\'t continue after Sae\'s prodding, she resists the urge to put her face in her hands. How does someone have the audacity to bluff this hard?</p>\n<p>Sae quickly gives an overview, though she prefaces it by saying you could get a lot better of one at the essence museum back on shore. She says that she can take Geneviah to it once they\'re on shore leave.</p>\n<p>She says:</p>\n<p><em>Basically... essence, as far as the people smarter than me can tell, is energy. It can interact with the world through its alignments. They have special names, but most just call them heat, cold, darkness, light, sound, and force.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Glyphs can channel essence, extract various alignments, and emit them however it likes. It\'s our tool with interacting with essence, as far as I know.</em>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Geneviah pipes up and asks, wait, if we can only interact with it through glyphs, what the hell happened yesterday?</p>\n<p>Sae sighs. That\'s the bad part: essence, as far as we can tell, wants to be used. It builds up if it isn\'t, and in areas without glyph usage, it starts leaking into reality. That\'s why there\'s those spots of darkness and light across the sea: it\'s areas where essence is breaking through into reality. It\'s also why we use so many force glyphs for the <em>Shanty</em>: we need to draw on a lot of the essence around us to avoid what happened last night.</p>\n<p>Geneviah nods, and Sae continues. <em>Anyway, so... glyphs are comprised of runes.</em> She holds up a kinetic glyph she had been carving. <em>Very briefly, you need an intake, refinement, and emission rune. Intake channels essence, refinement does something to it, and emission uses it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Geneviah says that makes sense, but asks about stopping essence.</p>\n<p>Sae just kind of looks at her weirdly. <em>You can\'t </em>stop<em> essence, Geneviah</em> she laughs. <em>It wants to be used.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Geneviah says, but like.. why. Sae responds with a vague <em>It\'s just how it is. Glyphs can\'t </em>stop<em> channeling essence</em>. She offers her guess: essence is under such great pressure that it needs an out, and any attempts they\'ve had on stopping or reducing the flow just doesn\'t work.</p>\n<p>Geneviah looks dismayed by this, and Sae agrees. It\'s hard to engineer good glyphs if you can\'t exactly turn them off, right?</p>\n<p>They go over a few refinement runes and emission runes, and Sae takes a thin lab of granite, which is decent for example glyphs, and asks Geneviah to give her some alignments and runes. She\'ll etch them, and she can watch how someone does it in real time.</p>\n<p>Geneviah gives her cold and darkness at first, and Sae kinda... deflates. She tells Geneviah that darkness is actually annihilative, and what it does isn\'t create darkness: it sucks light, sound, and essence out of the surrounding area. That\'s why they were etching it yesterday.</p>\n<p>Geneviah nods, and then asks why they can\'t do both. Sae says it\'s due to annihilative essence overtaking any other kind of essence in a glyph\'s immediate emission area. Geneviah just picks cold, then.</p>\n<p>Sae dials in and begins etching the glyph, and creates one. It\'s not her best work, but she shows Geneviah how to allow one to start channeling essence: you just finish off the intake rune.</p>\n<p>Geneviah asks why it works like, and Sae shrugs. Just how it does.</p>\n<p>The two sit back and watch the glyph as it shoots out cold-aligned essence, chilling and freezing a bit of the water.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, the glyph shatters, though Sae notices it and warns Geneviah. The two step back for a bit and watch as it cracks in half, exuding cold across the deck. Geneviah voices a realization: <em>Oh, that\'s why we unstrap the glyphs and let them fall into the ocean.</em> Sae nods, saying that a blast of force like that would either kill, maim, or knock them off the deck entirely. Or hurt the boat. Any of those is bad.</p>\n\n<h4>DOCKS</h4>\n\n<p>Geneviah\'s perspective.</p>\n<p>It\'s been a few hours. Sae takes over for Geneviah, and she goes to the front of the ship to take a nap after absorbing so much essence information.</p>\n<p>It\'s not that it was bad info: it was just a <em>lot</em>, and she only realizes now how much Sae knows about it. She has no doubts that Sae could talk about it for hours.</p>\n<p>However, before she can take a nap, she spots the faint outline of land on the horizon: it\'s slightly obfuscated by an essence dense pocket, but she can see land! She goes to ask the Captain how much longer it\'ll be before they dock. He laughs a little: eager to get off the ship?</p>\n<p>Geneviah pauses. No, she\'s not actually eager to get off the ship. She wants to continue being on it with Sae and seeing the ocean. It\'s terrifying, but something new she\'s never experienced.</p>\n<p>She says, seriously: no, she\'s not wanting to get off the ship. She asks him if he\'ll have her again next time, and he about lights up. He says he was hoping for her to ask that, and of course he wants her back. He confides in her that Sae had been approaching a bit of a slump in terms of her happiness: she just seemed lonely. Part of the reason he hired her was because he thought she\'d be a good friend, and based off what he\'s seen, they\'re getting there.</p>\n<p>Geneviah is relieved, both because he thinks Sae and her still have a shot at being friends, if not cordial on the <em>Shanty</em>, and that she\'ll be wanted on next time. She pauses and realizes he never answered her question: How long until we reach Sankhurst?</p>\n<p>He says it\'ll be a few hours: the glyphs move us fast.</p>\n<p>Geneviah nods, and goes back out to hang out with Sae. She feels invigorated after the talk with him, no more need for a nap.</p>\n<p>Vignette jump through a few hours: we see Geneviah telling Sae about her brother, Geneviah mentioning wanting to go to the essence museum, Sae\'s shock and eventually acceptance that someone wants to spend time with her, a force glyph almost exploding while Sae gets really into talking about the fun effects of a glyph she etched once, Geneviah telling Sae about her terrible manager from the docks, Sae talking about the essence museum and some exhibits she wants to show Geneviah, and Geneviah stopping her from going into another tangent about essence. Additionally, there\'s a moment where they just quietly sit and watch the shore approach. For Geneviah, it\'s something she\'s excited about: she notices Sae\'s anticipation, and she says that she hasn\'t spend long in Sankhurst for the last two years. Geneviah just says they have to make up for lost time.</p>\n<p>To Geneviah, it takes ages for the ship to pull into port: she\'s told by Sae to watch her as she slowly drops the speed of the ship so they can pull into their designated docking space in Sankhurst, and that she\'ll need to follow along the next time they\'re leaving Sankhurst. They can\'t go full speed near the docks, they\'ll spray it with seawater. Geneviah remarks that her manager when she worked as a dockworker would probably deserve it, and Sae laughs a little.</p>\n<p>The chapter ends with Geneviah touching solid ground, dragging Sae along with her into the city with the Captain\'s blessing.</p>','2024-10-29 20:34:44'),

To combat this, high-density housing (apartments, though the rare attached single family home is allowed for high-ranking members of the city government) has been built and maintained in residential zones. Additionally, above the factory zoning contains housing for workers. These apartments are assigned by the Housing Department, which also manages repairs and upgrades.</p>\n        <p>Most buildings in Sankhurst are built, primarily, out of brick with ceramic roofing. Interiors have cement floors, with metal furniture, including doors and bed-frames. Beds are constructed out of metal with cotton as filling. Only municipal buildings are granted additional materials, such as limestone bricks and tiled floors. Each apartment complex has the following structure:</p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center;\">+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|                Floor 3: Three bedroom,                |\n|               two bathroom apartments                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|                Floor 2: Two bedroom,                  |\n|               two bathroom apartments                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|                Floor 1: Two bedroom,                  |\n|               one bathroom apartments                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|         Floor 0: Housing Liaison,                     |\n| Group housing for liaison employees, maintenance      |\n|  sleeping quarters and workshop, as well as laundry   |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|              Floor -1: One bedroom,                   |\n|               one bathroom apartments                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|              Floor -2: One bedroom,                   |\n|               one bathroom apartments                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|              Floor -3: One bedroom,                   |\n|               one bathroom apartments                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n</pre>\n\n        <p>Newer apartments in Sankhurst are built with possible soundproofing in mind; this is done using annihilative glyphs embedded in walls between apartments, which absorb sound from other residents. Residents of newer apartment complexes may request soundproofing, and when payment is given, provided with a set of glyphs for that purpose. Each apartment is equipped with flowing water, a refrigerator powered by gelid glyphs, and a stovetop powered by torrid glyphs.\n            <br>\n        </p>\n        <p>Housing is assigned based on need; families on good terms will be allotted bigger apartments to save on apartment usage, while an individual may petition for their own personal apartment. Additionally, housing in businesses for employees is <em>not</em> a popular change, but the current Governor has no reason to change it, so he hasn\'t.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"business\" style=\"display: none;\">\n        <p>There are a fair number of private businesses in Sankhurst. Restaurants, glyph shops, education facilities, bars, clubs, etcetera. These have specific zoning in the city.</p>\n        <p>Some businesses are assigned housing units in their place of operation. Most new business complexes are built to include housing for its employees, but a lot of older ones do not, requiring the residential space to be identified. Typically group apartments, built into the floor the business is on. Businesses in these buildings are typically a lot closer.</p>\n        <p>There are no hotels, travel agencies, airports, or other tourist-based businesses in Sankhurst. As far as they know, there is no other civilization available to have tourists from, so these have no basis.</p>\n        <p>Instead, the economy is primarily driven by inter-business activities. Businesses buy raw materials or have contracts with the factories to produce and then sell items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"mixed-use\" style=\"display: none;\">\n        <p>Mixed-Use zones are residential and business zones combined. Typically under heavy demand, there is an extensive waiting list for these places. Only the more valuable members of Sankhurst\'s society live in these, usually. Other than that, just combines the residential and business units in the same building. These zones are present in the downtown/more popular areas.</p>\n        <p>The main reason for no below-ground units is to make them more appealing to citizens. No one likes living underground, frankly. Keeping these zones limited, both for foot-traffic and desirability purposes, keep the population working their hardest towards this as a reward.\n            <br>\n        </p>\n        <p>Their structure looks like this:</p>\n<pre style=\"text-align: center;\">+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|     Floor 3: Three bedroom, two bathroom apartments   |\n|             Business* and Housing for employees       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|     Floor 2: Two bedroom, two bathroom apartments     |\n|             Business* and Housing for employees       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|     Floor 1: Two bedroom, one bathroom apartments     |\n|             Business* and housing for employees       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|      Floor 0: Housing Liaison, Commercial Liaison     |\n|    Group housing for liaison employees, maintenance   |\n|  sleeping quarters and workshop, as well as laundry   |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\n</pre>\n\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"argiculture\" style=\"display: none;\">\n        <p>Agriculture consists of two sections: Hydroponics, and Bay Farming.</p>\n        <p>Hydroponics is a large excavated underground space filled with hydroponics bays. The city of Sankhurst relies on these, designed for optimal growth by use of light-aligned glyphs.</p>\n        <p>The hydroponics building consists of a series of hydroponic towers, separated into sections of herbs/vegetables being grown. Water is brought in from the ocean via a canal dug through the mixed-use zone, then boiled to remove the salt and any ocean-based pathogens. It\'s then mixed with a nutrient slurry, then used to water the plants in the hydroponics bays.</p>\n        <p>This zone of Sankhurst also includes insect breeding for protein, as surviving on a purely vegetable diet is untenable. It was folded into the Hydroponics zone, but those who work on insect breeding <em>really</em> think it should be a different zone. It was assigned to the responsibilities of the Hydroponics workers, but expanding it into its own zone isn\'t a priority for the Governor. It leads to a small amount of discontent among Agriculture workers.</p>\n        <p>Nonetheless, they breed crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers, which are then served alongside the vegetable portions.</p>\n        <p>They grow the following vegetables in the Hydroponics pit:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Lettuce variety</li>\n            <li>Spinach</li>\n            <li>Cucumbers</li>\n            <li>Basil</li>\n            <li>Tomatoes</li>\n            <li>Bell Peppers</li>\n            <li>Onions</li>\n            <li>Among others</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Hydroponics also grows non-edible plants:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Flax - To create linen, useful for clothing, bed covers, blankets, pillows, etc.</li>\n            <li>Cotton - As a stuffing material for beds, blankets, and others.</li>\n            <li>Hemp - For rope, textiles, and fibers.</li>\n            <li>Mushrooms - For mushroom leather, as a replacement for animal leather.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Bay Farming is primarily seaweed farming in the Chesapeake Bay. This is used to generate biochar for steel production in the factories. Seaweed grown for biochar does not need to be processed further to remove essence contamination, as they will just be burnt; for cooking, seaweed requires absorption glyphs to draw out essence from the vegetable before it can be consumed safely.</p>\n        <p>The prevalence of tropical storms make typical farmland untenable, leading to Hydroponics and Bay Farming as the only viable options for food production.\n            <br>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"municipal\" style=\"display: block;\">\n        <p>Municipal buildings are a mix of department buildings and City Hall.

When tropical storms, empowered by essence or not, hit the city, acoustic glyphs are sounded to get the citizens. They are reinforced to avoid this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"factories\" style=\"display: none;\">\n        <p>Factories produce a variety of materials. The factories are dug into the ground, containing large smokestacks that release the byproducts of their operations. They handle, primarily, construction of housing materials, such as brick, metal, ceramic, metal support beams, as well as essence worker materials, such as essence lighters and metallic glyphs cast out of iron or copper.</p>\n        <p>Factories are mostly powered by glyphs, involving air conditioning via gelid glyphs, and run twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. A large portion of the city\'s population is employed in the factories. However, factory work does not require a consistent level of staff; the night runs on a skeleton crew, while the day shift has a full labor load.</p>\n        <p>It is not a desire to have the factories run twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. A tropical storm devastated supply resources (detailed later under \"Recent History\"), and the factories are running full-time to catch up and have a steady supply. Twenty four seven to match both demand from citizens and demand for supply stores.\n            <br>\n        </p>\n        <p>The factories also have a high degree of safety standards, given the city\'s low population and inability to replenish it via importing workers from other cities.</p>\n        <p>Sankhurst\'s Industry division relies on a consistent input of raw iron, raw copper, limestone, clay and essence stone. Additionally, seaweed is farmed and imported into the factories to undergo pyrolysis for steel manufacturing.</p>\n        <p>These materials come from various mines outside of Sankhurst across what we would call modern-day Virginia. They are delivered in by teams in</p>\n        <p>The factories produce a variety of materials, and run at all times of day and night. The following is a list:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Common-use glyphs cast in copper and iron. Steel glyphs are less common, but useful for specific applications. Discussed further in the Essence world-building page.</li>\n            <li>Sleds, built from steel to transport raw ore via the department of Mining. Described later in detail.</li>\n            <li>Replacement parts for the Hydroponics bays.</li>\n            <li>Anything necessary for cities to function. Pipes, bricks for building, steel beams for building construction, etcetera.</li>\n            <li>Clothing is weaved from flax, cotton, and hemp.</li>\n            <li>Shoes are crafted from mycelium, turned into leather, and hemp for fabric.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Additionally, manufacturing is responsible for the production of specialized glyphs using essence stone, a rare type of material that has exceptionally high essence throughput. Described in more detail in Essence world-building document.</p>\n        <p>Absorption glyphs prevent noise pollution, but the factories are not a quiet place.</p>\n        <p>In terms of regular pollution, normally it would be a problem to have the factories that close to the city. However, due to the wild winds whipped up by the essence in the air, the pollution is blown away from the city before it becomes a problem.</p>\n        <p>Sleds are complex vehicles, built using a combination of absorption and force runes to levitate a metal platform above the ground, for transporting goods and people across areas without roads.\n            <br>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"docks\" style=\"display: none;\">\n        <p>The Docks are a zone designated for fishing boats to dock with, transporting their catches off their ship. Fishing is not a very good career choice for the current world, given the risks associated with sailing on an essence-soaked ocean.</p>\n        <p>However, fishing is rewarded highly, so those who pursue it typically are given priority from Sustenance, Housing, and other Municipal departments as they contribute more to Sankhurst. The docks contain buildings to process the marine catches, and store them until Sustenance can collect them for further distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n\n<p>Sankhurst has a culture of subsistence. The city and its populace are in a perpetual precarious position, and careful management of its populace, space, and resource usage are necessary to keep it afloat. They are completely isolated from any other cities or towns; the only people outside of Sankhurst, to their knowledge, are the mining outputs (explained in next section), leading to a kind of... \"We\'re the last ones, no one will save us.\"</p>\n<p>This has led to the motto of Sankhurst being \"No One Else Will\". It is the ironclad will of the people: no one else will do this, so I must. Nearly every citizen of Sankhurst has a high skill in self-discipline, as this ideal is taught from the start of schooling, to job training, to every moment someone does something. No one else will, so I must. This is reinforced by every interaction one has in Sankhurst; no actions of kindness, but of necessity. This person needs help, no one else will help, so I will. There\'s some government messaging reinforcing it, but only in education and training for jobs.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>However, there are some cultural notes. Sankhurst is comprised of hard, weary people, where cooperation is prioritized above all else. Generally, selfish actions are less common due to common need. Additionally, there is a culture of crafts. Essence workers craft specialized glyphs for citizen use.</p>\n<p>There\'s some public works, such as sculpting, painting, and others. Citizens showing artistic talents are given the opportunity to work creatively, for the purposes of morale. Paintings are very uncommon, given the lack of dyes, but sculpture and more esoteric art are common. Glyph-based art (light sculptures, acoustic art) is common, requiring an understanding of essence work.</p>\n<p>Any artists employed by the Sankhurst government do not spend all their time making art pieces; they must hold a job, either in the factories or in private businesses in Sankhurst.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>There are three public history museums: the Museum of Essence Work, the Museum of Sankhurst, and the Museum of Manufacturing. Each details the history of their chosen topic, and are constantly added to as advancements are made. These serve as introductions into what keep Sankhurst afloat, as well as what to be proud of in the city.\n    <br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Mining</h3>\n\n<p>Mining is done outside of Sankhurst, across what we\'d describe as modern-day Virginia. A series of mines are established around areas that were known, prior to the essence explosion event two hundred years ago, to be rich in natural ore required for manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Digging in general is done via a specialized glyph; it shoots force through the ground, several times a second, for over a minute. It completely breaks down dirt, bedrock, and some ores, allowing separate teams to gather crushed ore up, sift it, then ready it for transfer to Sankhurst. This allows for teams to be solely focused on the retrieval, sorting, and delivery of materials, rather than delegating large amounts of people to mining.</p>\n<p>These mining outposts require staff, and so citizens of Sankhurst are deployed to it on trips to collect ore. They do not return until their time out there is up, and once they do, they are highly rewarded. The dangers of mining require that reward: essence density outside of Sankhurst (effects described in Essence document) requires a high level of risk from people on those outposts.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>There is also digging for clay, which is transferred back to Sankhurst for further processing.</p>\n\n<h3>Government</h3>\n\n<p>Government in Sankhurst is maintained by the Municipal departments outlined above, but the decisions are made by the Governor of Sankhurst. The governor is an autocratic position, who provides direction for the city\'s departments and hears appeals from citizens. Governors serve until death or retirement, at which point their will dictates a successor. If no successor is given, the heads of Enforcement, Sustenance, Mining, Industry, Infrastructure and Transit, Housing, Commerce, Health, and Education, in that order, are selected to be the next Governor.</p>\n<p>Over the 200 years of recorded history after the essence crisis, the Governorship system of rule was preceded by a council. However, the Logistics representative for that council decided to overthrow the existing council and institute an autocratic rule, with him at the lead. The coup was successful, though it could barely be called a coup. More details in a currently unwritten work.</p>\n<p>The autocratic rule of the Governor has proceeded without much cause for failure for the next two hundred years. Most citizens are happy under the rule; it was instituted to stop the inefficiencies that result from needed quorum, and every Governor has named a worthy successor. This long-present system has resulted in a Title forming: the Governor Title, which is inherited by each new Governor of Sankhurst.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>However, there\'s also a growing section of unhappiness in regards to the Governorship system of rule, especially given previous Governors\' decisions and how they affected the populace. This has lead to a group establishing themselves as petitioners for a less autocratic rule, but so far, they haven\'t been effective.</p>\n<p>They will be <span class=\"illegible\">the main driving force for the plot, spurring </span>Geneviah<span class=\"illegible\"> and </span>Sae<span class=\"illegible\">towards overthrowing the Governorship way of power of establishing a new council, discovering the cause behind the essence crisis and embarking on a quest to fix it.</span>\n\n</p>\n\n<h3>Commerce</h3>\n\n<p>Commerce in the city of Sankhurst is based around a credit system. Every citizen\'s name is in books handled by the Commerce department, with a given number for the assets and debts, along with purchase history.</p>\n<p>When a purchase is made at a private business in Sankhurst, the product or service that was purchased is on hold until it is verified with Commerce. Once it is verified, the purchaser can return to the private business to finish with the transaction.</p>\n<p>However, for time-critical purchases, a temporary grant can be allowed per-business to take the item or set up the service that day. However, if the purchase is found to be invalid, it can result in consequences from Commerce.</p>\n<p>The specifics of these is left up to the writer, none will be defined here.</p>\n<p>All citizens have their credit count upped to two hundred if it is below that; this allows citizens to keep the economy flowing.</p>\n\n<h3>Education</h3>\n\n<p>Education in Sankhurst is government-funded and controlled. General education is done from nine years old to seventeen; starting at the basics and traveling towards specialties, based on a determination of what your skills are geared towards.</p>\n<p>These are in the \"Business\" zoning of Sankhurst.</p>\n<p>In addition to general education, there are facilities for learning how to etch glyphs by hand, learning how to create art using various methods, learning the basics of how the factories/agriculture zones operate, and learning how to work on the from the docks.</p>\n<p>All those facilities are typically taught by experienced masters for that area of work, to educate students. Each master typically takes on at least four students at once.</p>\n<p>The time taken for education varies, but masters are compensated by their work per-session. This is to encourage fast progress to avoid payments. If a student or master is struggling with the subject, an Education liaison steps in to verify they are the right fit.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Education also holds competency tests for all students pronounced fit by their teacher; if the student fails this, they are not allowed to work in the field in which they were taught, and the teacher is proctored to verify they are instructing properly.</p>\n<p>This has led to some friction between masters of their field and Education; masters view them as a blocker towards true instruction, while Education views the masters, at the worst, as unqualified wrecks poisoning students\' minds. To be fair, there are some truly terrible teachers for specific fields, but Education has seen them, and it\'s hard not to assume the worst.</p>\n\n<h3>Healthcare</h3>\n\n<p>Healthcare is strained in Sankhurst, given the lack of modern-day advancements. Saving people from disease is hard, so instead, the city prioritizes preventing disease. Soap for handwashing and knowledge for hygiene are handed out like candy.</p>\n<p>Exposure to endemic diseases as a child in safe conditions to gain immunity later in life is very common, given someone has the disease. This is usually a rotating cycle; adults who have had the disease spread it to children, who grow up immune, who then can\'t spread it to their kids.</p>\n<p>Healthcare clinics are spread across every zone; basic first aid is given, along with specific practitioner requests for midwifery, infection management, and chronic disease management.</p>\n<p>Medical practitioners are deployed to the mining outposts for on-site medical assistance, but recovery from injury and death are statistically lower in on outposts.</p>\n\n<h4>Mental Health</h4>\n\n<p>Mental health is primarily managed by peer support groups. One-on-one care is very uncommon; typically only done in extreme cases where group therapy would be ineffective.</p>','2024-10-06 00:52:19'),

The walls were cast in the shadows of the woman hanging above their newest exhibit: the Rhuesian Diamond.</p>\n\n<p>Which was in the hands of the woman hovering above the case. The case which was now empty, with a hole in the side.</p>\n\n<p>A museum robbery? Really? In today\'s day and age?<br></p>\n\n<p>As her grip steadied, she got a good look at the hovering lady in the museum. Her brain filed away the facts about her appearance in a neat list, each line signed off with a flourish:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>She wasn\'t, in fact, hovering: she was suspended by a line that extended upwards, into the skylight where a winch sat.</li>\n    <li>The woman had a cheshire grin framed by twin strands of black hair, the rest pulled back into a bun.</li>\n    <li>Her body language was lazy and languid, her pose relaxed. She was clutching the diamond to her chest, and did not look at all surprised to see a security guard.</li>\n    <li>The lady\'s body was clad in a bodysuit that was entirely too form-fitting, and was not helping Melinda\'s composure in any way.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As she stared at the burglar, the grin expanded on the woman\'s face. \"Staring at you has been lovely,\" was carried to her ears by a low, smokey voice. \"But I really do need to jet. Can\'t be here when the cops arrive!\"</p>\n\n<p>Melinda watched in helpless horror as the woman gave a tug on the line, effortlessly ascending toward the skylight. \"Stop! You\'re under...,\" she called out, but her voice faltered as the thief blew her a kiss. Before Melinda could even blink, the thief was gone, leaving nothing but the faint sound of the winch echoing in the empty room.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>They called her the Diamond Thief, which, honestly, was a bit lazy. Especially considering most of her heists had nothing to do with diamonds.</p>\n<p>Melinda guessed that was due to the diamond being part of a high profile exhibit. The rest was artwork.</p>\n\n<p>She had been unceremoniously fired after she failed to stop the Diamond Thief, which was frankly ridiculous. What the hell was she supposed to do to stop a woman hovering above her?</p>\n\n<p>When they couldn\'t answer her, she grabbed her bag and left to apply to other jobs. Not like there was a lack of jobs for security guards now that they were on high alert.</p>\n\n<p>It was on her sixth day at the Museum of Science where she got a surprise. She couldn\'t exactly call it an <em>ugly</em> surprise; the burglar was annoyingly attractive, even with a chunk of meteorite in her arms.</p>\n\n<p>She already had a taser lined up with her flashlight, illuminating the thief. She was halfway through forming the demand to stop moving before she realized it was the same woman. The Diamond Thief had her eyes on a meteorite, for some godforsaken reason.</p>\n\n<p>\"Diamond Thief!\" Melinda yelled, launching into a sprint. The thief spun, wobbling under the weight of the meteorite.</p>\n\n<p>Her face broke out into a strained grin.&nbsp;\"Oh, look, it\'s the pretty security guard again!\" The thief nodded toward the exit, her grin widening. \"Mind grabbing the door for me? My hands are full, and-\"</p>\n\n<p>The thief\'s face only had a fraction of a second to morph into shock before Melinda crashed headlong into her. The meteorite went flying as the two crashed into the floor, bodies entangled.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for the thief, she did not smack her face into the linoleum of the museum floor.</p>\n\n<p>Melinda was not so lucky, and the room swam as her head hit the floor. Time passed in a disconcerting wave as she heard the far-away sound of latex against waxed floor, then that same smokey voice uttering a curse.</p>\n\n<p>She only heard the door opening before unconsciousness claimed her.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\"Why didn\'t you use the taser? You know, the one we specifically issued for use on someone robbing the museum?\"\n\n</p>\n<p>Melinda couldn\'t find a good answer, and was unceremoniously booted out of the Museum of Science.</p>\n<p>She dusted herself off, and left to find a new job.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>A week later and another chase: \"STOP! I\'M TELLING YOU, STOP!\"</p>\n<p>Melinda panted, running as fast she could after the thief. No false warnings from the Diamond Thief are going to stop her from-</p>\n<p>She didn\'t see the wet floor sign until she was finished watching the Diamond Thief leave through the window of the Museum of African History, with a tribal spear under her arm.</p>\n<p>The wink she was given by the Diamond Thief did not contribute to her whipping her head around in any way.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Melinda had <em>finally</em> gotten the woman\'s arms behind her back. She was struggling wildly as Melinda searched for her handcuffs.</p>\n<p>Five jobs, this lady had cost her. And she had <em>finally</em> gotten her.&nbsp;Her fingers closed around the handcuffs at her hip, finally. But before she could lock them in place, the world spun. Suddenly, it was Melinda’s wrists in the cuffs.</p><p> She rolled her body over to see her greatest enemy on this planet flick sweat off her face, pick up the <em>Albert Einstein\'s priceless diary</em>,\n    and stroll out the front door of the Museum of history.</p>\n<p>She was found shortly by another security guard, cursing the name of the Diamond Thief.</p>\n<p>-</p><p>Melinda stared at her phone, showing a cheery $129.34 dollars in her checking account.</p><p>Only one way to handle this.</p><p>She pulled up the map program, and set it to the nearest bar.</p><p>-</p>\n<p>Melinda stared down the glass of her IPA as she mumbled under her breath.</p>\n<p>\"I\'ve worked at every damn museum in this city, I swear. Every time, a few days in, this fucking lady shows up and ruins it.\"</p>\n<p>She raised her head to take another drink of the bitter beer. \"This last time, she <em>handcuffed</em> me. At my <em>job</em>.\"</p>\n<p>The bartender nodded solemnly, sliding her another glass.</p>\n<p>\"Of course I lost my job there too. I\'m gonna have to apply to work as a security guard at a daycare, and she\'ll <em>still</em> show up to steal a <em>kid</em> or some shit.\"</p>\n<p>Her vision was swimming. She had lost the plot some hours ago when she had shown up here, and it had only become more and more so as she got deeper into whatever the bar had on tap. She probably should\'ve asked before demanding a glass.</p>\n<p>A blur showed up to her left, and she turned an eye.</p>\n<p>\"Well, hello there. Rough night?\" The voice was familiar, but she had worked at seven jobs in the last two months. She had watched so many training videos it was a shock that she still found new types of voices to listen to.</p>\n<p>\"Ha! Don\'t you know it, lady.\" She swallowed another mouthful of the beer. \"No one comes to this bar unless they\'re having a bad night.\"</p>\n<p>A soft chuckle floated out of the lady. \"My night certainly wasn\'t great, but seeing you made it better.\"</p>\n<p>Melinda rubbed her eyes, but the room didn\'t clear up. \"I’m so deep in this pit, I’ll probably forget tonight. And trust me,\" she gestured to herself, \"you don’t want this.\"</p>\n<p>The lady hummed a tone. \"Actually, I\'d say wanting you is what got me here in the first place. My partner wasn’t exactly thrilled when they found out I was interested in someone else.\"</p>\n<p>She snorted, a bubble rising in her throat. \"That\'s the peak for me, causing the end of a relationship by getting wasted at a bar. So sorry, lady.\"</p>\n<p>Melinda felt a hand on hers. \"I can think of a way you could make it up to me.\"</p>\n<p>A flush spread down her numbed system. Hell of a way to lighten up an evening.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Sunlight crept in through the window, and she snorted awake. A pounding headache broke through her tiredness, and a warm body stirred next to her.</p>\n<p>She didn\'t remember getting some last night, but it looks like drunk-Melinda managed to pull something. She committed herself to giving drunk-her a raise, and let out a groan as she raised a hand to block the sun from entering her fragile eyes.</p>As her eyes adjusted to the light, she noticed unfamiliar clothes strewn across the floor—black tank top, dress pants, definitely not hers. Her heart sank as her gaze drifted to the figure lounging in the bed next to her, too comfortably for comfort. \"Morning, miss security guard.\" came the low, smokey voice.<br><p>Melinda had a vortex of feelings inside her, but she opted for the easiest response.<br></p><p>\"Morning, reason I can\'t hold down a job for more than a week,\" she groaned, rubbing her temples. \"And the reason I probably won\'t make rent this month.\"</p>','2024-09-16 23:33:27'),

She was ambling towards the counter, and Sophie <em>knew</em> she was going to be the only one wiling to deal with a customer this early in the morning.</p>\n<p>By the time she got to the counter, the woman was leaning against it like it was the only thing holding her up in a world that had gone completely insane.</p>\n<p>Sophie politely coughed to get the customer\'s attention. She watched as the lady\'s head whipped up, and recognition flashed in her eyes. \"Sophia. You don\'t know me, not yet, but I promise I can make your day much more interesting.\"</p>\n<p>Yeah, this wasn\'t the first time someone had used that line on her, but it certainly was the first time her work uniform inspired it. \"Look, miss, I\'m-\" A hand smushed her lips together, and outraged surged. How fucking dare she!</p>\n<p>\"I know you\'re mad, because I know a lot of things. You have a time travel pass-code, which has <em>never</em> gotten old each time I\'ve used it.\" She took a breath. \"Five hundred and forty seven, correct horse battery stapling, thirty ostriches won the Austrian war, and...\"</p>\n<p>She leaned close to Sophie\'s face. A pause in the breathless rant allowed her outrage to freeze into shock. \"You once lost your virginity in an Arby\'s parking lot, in a stolen car.\" The shock shattered into several pieces.<br></p>\n<p>\"And before you say \'You found that in my journal\'\" - an accurate impression of her tone, if not her pitch - \"you\'ve never written it down there, and you don\'t use social media, so it\'s not like I could find it there.\"</p>\n<p>Sophie\'s jaw hung slackly open as the woman spread her arms out. \"I\'m a time traveler, and I really want your help. Come with me? I have a plane ticket with your name on it.\"</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\"So, welcome back to the O\'Hare airport.\" The woman - her name was Ivy, last name Harrow - spun around, stumbling into the woman in front of them. \"You know? Fifty times I\'ve been here, but it\'s a different person in front of me in line every time.\"</p>\n<p>Sophie nodded. \"Yeah, that\'s real interesting.\" She swiped away a text from her manager, asking her where the hell she was. \"Hey, any chance you can help me out with my job? They aren\'t happy about me ditching the Sunday shift to hang out with a crazy woman.\"</p>\n<p>A chortle came from Ivy. \"Crazy, huh? What\'d you tell them this time?\"</p>\n<p>\"I said you were on a mission of life and death, and I was being swept up in it.\" She flicked <em>another</em> text, this time from her dad.</p>\n<p>\"Ha! I knew it. You owe me thirty dollars.\"</p>\n<p>Sophie spluttered. \"We haven\'t even bet! I\'ve known you an hour!\"</p>\n<p>A wink from the woman in front of her. \"But I\'ve known you many years, and last time you bet you would say I was your girlfriend having a personal crisis. Not like money\'s an issue for us.\" She pulled out her phone - a beat up thing - and showed her an app.</p>\n<p>It was a line-graph, trending steadily upward over the last five hours. \"I can\'t say I wouldn\'t exploit the stock market... how much are you aiming for?\"  </p>\n<p>A whistle as Ivy\'s finger tapped against her chin. \"...I\'m aiming for a billion? I was able to hit fifty billion by doing some unsavory things, but I\'m really hoping for this to be the last one, and hacking high-profile Twitter accounts to manipulate stocks is just gonna get me in trouble.\"</p><p>Her finger continued tapping against her chin. \"It\'s not even about the money. I want enough to live on, but it\'s more about the fact I <em>can</em> do it rather than the need to get as much as possible.\" The finger stopped. \"It\'s a bit rote by now.\"<br></p>\n<p>Her words finally found their way through her throat. \"A billion dollars from <em>stock trading</em> won\'t get you in trouble!?\"</p>\n<p>Ivy\'s eyes lit up. \"Actually, it won\'t!\" The line shuffled forward. \"I tested it. I don\'t get audited immediately unless I break the two billion barrier, so a billion should be fine. Plenty for you and me to live off of, right?\"</p>\n<p>Before she could respond to that - was she and Ivy <em>involved</em> in a previous loop? - she was being ushered forward by a TSA agent, and she fished out her driver\'s license.</p>\n<p>Ivy had purchased her a ticket to Geneva Airport in Switzerland, and from her frenzied Googling on Business class for United was that Ivy had dropped over five thousand dollars on her alone.</p>\n<p>She tried not to let her nerves show as she went through the scanner, and then pat-down. Sophie hadn\'t been told by Ivy <em>why</em> she was wanted here, but from all available evidence the woman was a time traveler. It was all she could do not to thrash the lady with her questions, but once they got on the plane she\'d have time to press her.</p>\n<p>Still. Business class for someone you just met. Her mind reeled as she grabbed her bag off the conveyor. The time travel must have driven her <em>batty</em>.</p>\n<p>-<br></p>\n<p>Sophia was chowing down on an airport sandwich and fries. Ivy was sipping on a Coca-Cola float, idly dipping a fry into her dessert-y beverage with one hand as she manipulated the stock market with another. Sophie wasn\'t allowed to look at the bill, but it was <em>airport food</em>.</p><p>If the time looper across the table wasn\'t currently making more cash than Sophie had ever seen in her life, she would\'ve fussed at the waste of money. As it stood, she was enjoying the hell out of her reuben.</p><p>\"So, I need to get the money stuff wrapped up before we board. We have...\" Ivy\'s eyes flashed to the clock on the wall. \"Thirty-five minutes till we board, and then a nine hour flight to Geneva.\" Her eyes went to Sophie, and she froze while chewing the sandwich. \"We\'ll be able to talk on the plane about all the stuff you want to bring up.\"</p><p>She managed to swallow her latest bite. \"I can\'t believe you. You knew my pass-code, so you <em>are</em> a time traveler, but to drop the thousands of dollars on tickets for the both of us... how long have you been looping?\"</p><p>A finger wagged in above her plate. \"Not now! On the plane. Promise not to ask any more, and I\'ll answer this one.\"</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>A drum-roll played from Ivy\'s hands rattling against their table. \"The answer is... approximately a hundred and seventy years!\" Sophie blinked. She tried to comprehend what Ivy had just said. A hundred and seventy years. _Fifty thousand_ days. She couldn\'t even wrap her head around the idea of living the same day for a hundred years, let alone staying sane through it.</p><p>\"I know what you\'re about to ask next, and I\'ll go ahead and answer it for you. Special privilege, since you didn\'t directly ask.\" A wink towards her, fast as lightning. \"How did I stay sane? Not sure I did!\" A crazed smile crept onto Ivy\'s face. \"I\'m pretty sure I went nutty ten years in, but nuttiness is tied to your physical brain, and believe it or not that gets reset.\"</p><p>Two fingers walked their way across the table as Sophie\'s mind began to resemble a fork in a garbage disposal. \"I woke up one day and realized I wasn\'t crazy anymore. Or at least, I think I\'m not. Good enough to convince a series of psychiatrists!\"</p><p>The two fingers stopped at the edge of the table. \"I don\'t think I\'m crazy, anyway. Definitely maladjusted, given that I\'ve been living in a free-for-all sandbox nearly my whole life. I\'ll definitely need some help adjusting once I break it today.\"</p><p><br></p>','2024-09-18 00:30:02'),

He takes a hammer, and knocks out a chunk of the rock onto the concrete floor.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>Two hundred years later, an artist leans into her instincts and allows her hands to work on their own. Without her conscious direction, a piece of the rock she was working with is knocked out of the rock, replicating the event from the past.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>She\'s taken the first step to claiming her Title.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>In <em>Runic</em>, there exists a collective unconsciousness of humanity. Every instinct built up over the course of a life is shunted into this unconsciousness. Currently, it contains every bit of instinct built up over humanity\'s history.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>It is possible to draw on these unconscious instincts. To even have a chance, one must become so comfortable with an action that it becomes second nature to them. Then, a deep meditation is necessary to touch the unconsciousness. That connection, once made, is weak: it can snap at the slightest uncertainty, and once snapped, requires another meditation session to reconnect. Making that connection is called \"Becoming Titled\", and it grants you a Title.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>The connection to the collective unconsciousness can be weakened by extreme physical injury, abandoning the field the Title is related to, or not utilizing the Instincts given by the collective unconsciousness. If it\'s too weak, it\'ll snap.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Once snapped, the previously Titled individual loses all Instincts, which can be extremely disorienting. Once they reconnect, they need to rebuild their connection to its previous state. This means that keeping a Title is very important to those who are Titled.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>This makes Titles rare, but not so rare that they\'re mythical; it simply requires skill and patience. It usually takes someone older, though there are some younger people with Titles.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>When someone achieves a Title, nothing visibly happens. The individual may stutter on connecting to the collective unconsciousness, but the changes are all internal. The Titled individual can accept the Title given to them, and once they have, the connection between the collective unconscious and the Titled person is made. If they don\'t accept the Title before they exit the meditative state, they can access it again at any time.</p>\n<p>The Titled individual will know instinctively what their Title is. Example: Governor, Captain, Saleswoman, etc.</p>\n<p>Titles can and will naturally transition into other Titles. Typically, this is done by transitioning from a less specific to a more specific Title, though there are instances where a person can transition to an unrelated Title. This can occur if they\'re in a stressful situation and take up a mantle like Rescuer, or something similar.</p>\n<p>Title transitions keep your existing Instincts, giving you breadth of new ones and depth to your old ones that apply to your new Title\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Over time, as long as the individual performs or stays connected to the actions that caused them to earn the Title in the first place, the connection will strengthen. This allows them to get more information from their Instincts, and draw on more than the immediately relevant ones for their current action.</p>\n<p>There are no instincts for relying on Instincts heavily. The worst it can give you is a slight headache as you delve into the collective unconsciousness. However, when a person first becomes Titled, the adjustment of having Instincts can be difficult.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Once connected, one must strengthen their connection by drawing on the Instincts available in the collective unconsciousness. These Instincts can contradict rarely, and it\'s up to the Titled individual to choose which Instinct to believe. However, that\'s very rare.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>These can roughly be divided into passive and active Instincts.</p>\n\n<h4>\n    Active Instincts\n</h4>\n\n<p>Active instincts are logical instincts that can be cognitively engaged with. It is akin to having arrived at a conclusion you\'re not quite sure how you got to.</p>\n<p>They can be queried. As an example, take a look at the following passage:</p>\n<p><em>A man frowns over his battle plans. He\'s had this sneaking suspicion since his lieutenant passed him these; something about it is </em>off<em>.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>He looks across the map. The army\'s path leads straight through the valley, which </em>could<em> lead to further issues as it\'s a choke-point...</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>A sudden clicking feeling in his mind tells the General he\'s right. There\'s a chance for a battle here; a weakness his subordinate should have seen miles before this even got to his desk. Why-</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>A knife slipping into his back told him the why.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>As shown in the example, the General has an Instinct; call it Battle Weariness, or whatever. Point being, it tells him when something might go sideways. Once he isolated the idea that it was the valley that was the problem, his Instinct told him it was correct.</p>\n<p>If he had been allowed to continue on, he probably would\'ve been able to isolate his lieutenant\'s betrayal, if not the why.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Active Instincts are Instincts that can be queried. They act akin to your own thoughts; a logical deduction, but you\'re not quite sure where it\'s coming from.\n    <br>\n</p>\n\n<h4>\n    Passive Instincts\n</h4>\n\n<p>Passive Instincts are Instincts based in emotion. A Passive Instinct is one that gives you a bad feeling about a dark alley, one that worms its way into your brain and tells you \"this is not the right way.\"</p>\n<p>They <em>cannot</em> be engaged with. Passive instincts will come unbidden, and cannot be dismissed. As an example, take a look at the following passage:</p>\n<p><em>The Stonecarver examines the design. It\'s a few circles, arranged concentrically, with four axis lines from the center moving to the edges.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>It\'s not that it\'s </em>bad<em>, per se. His apprentice did a fine job with the stonework. She\'ll go far with that kind of skill. But something is niggling at him.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>It\'s just... not good? The design doesn\'t mean anything.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p><em>He turns to his apprentice, the poor sod, and hardens his heart.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>As you can hopefully see from that example, a Passive Instinct caused the Stonecarver to find the design his apprentice gave him unpleasant. That is the nature of a Passive Instinct: it is one that guides you through emotion away or to a certain conclusion. A good colloquial is a gut feeling.</p>\n\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n\n<p>Titles are uncommon, and the method to getting one is unknown. The only things people know is that you must be skilled, you must be patient, you must have extraordinary focus, and then it\'s just a matter of luck.</p>\n<p>Research on how Titles work, however, is a lot more common. So far, they\'ve figured out most of how Instincts work.</p>\n<p>Titles are something most people aspire to. Some people don\'t care. It\'s usually a sign of prestige in a field to be Titled, a showcase of skill and effort. There are some people who believe it\'s a sign from above to be Titled.</p>\n<p>Some who get their Titles early face malice from people without Titles in the same field.</p>\n<p>A large barrier to getting a Title is the patience. You really need to go with the floor and let your instincts take over to touch the collective unconsciousness, and most aren\'t capable of it. This leads to frustration and discontent among people who have tried for years or decades and have never gotten a hint of it.</p>\n<p>In Sankhurst, the only setting in <em>Runic</em>, Titles are viewed highly. Those who have them are highly valued by the city, and given good accommodations and special consideration, along with a larger stipend from Commerce.</p>\n<p>Titled individuals are often expected to pitch in more than people without Titles, and teach those who are in the same field. If they don\'t do this, they lose the benefits given to Titled people in Sankhurst.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Titles have always been pretty important, though records of important Titled individuals were lost after the Essence crisis (see Essence Worldbuilding). The only notable Titles in Sankhurst, at the moment, are Sae\'s teacher, the current Governor, and others.\n    <br>\n</p>','2024-10-21 23:21:52'),

Complete focus on the task of carving channels along the surface of the stone for essence to race down.</p>\n<p>That was her intent, sharp as her tool. Her movements flowed like so easily, leaving the rest of her mind free to sink even deeper into the emptiness.</p>\n<p>A crash on the dock in front of her dragged her out of that meditative state, and the world came back to her. The glyph base in her hand had a nasty error in its channel, with a scattering of dust and small pieces of the surface across her lap.</p>\n<p>She fixed a glare on the dockworkers in front of the ship. Over hundreds of visits in the last two years, this group was by far the laziest.</p>\n<p>The lone dockloader, a woman in a loose-fitting white shirt stood motionless, her despondent gaze fixed on the scattered metal boxes.</p>\n<p>A chorus of jeers from her useless fellows spurred her into action, righting one box at a time.</p>\n<p>Her gaze drifted to the group lounging by the concrete walls separating the Docks of Sankhurst from the rest of the city. They had done <em>nothing</em> for the last <em>three hours</em>, and her patience had ran thin after hour one.</p>\n<p>If they were all working, they would\'ve loaded the ship for their next few voyages out in an hour or two at maximum, causing minimal disruption to her work.</p>\n<p>That isn\'t the case, apparently. Instead, Sae had been dropped out of her focus by the difficulties of the lone dockloader <em>multiple times</em>. Not that Sae blamed her: the only dockloader with any work ethic had been as quick as she could.</p>\n<p>Still. She had been so close that time to reaching the meditative state in her etching... she had only reached it five times since moving to the boat. She still hadn\'t felt a whisper of what she was looking for, and she probably wouldn\'t with the constant interruptions.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>She sighed, stretching. Her back made an ungainly pop as her arms reached the peak of their rotation. Sae winced. Definitely not good. She needs to get up for a bit. Before she does, though...</p>\n<p>She hunched over the essence stone serving as the glyph base, ignoring the sharp pain from her back as she did. There was a poor technique for fixing this gouge across the surface of the stone. If essence flowed through this as it was, it would leak into the stone itself. It was unacceptable for her work to include such an error.</p>\n<p>She angled her etcher, a metal tool ending in a sharp, flat rectangular slope. Sae was gifted it when she was fifteen, its head shiny-new despite its age. Its handle was wrapped in leather for a better grip, the only part of it that hadn\'t been replaced since she had gotten it.</p>\n<p>It was <em>hers</em>. Not many things on the boat were.</p>\n<p>She positioned the tool against the channel the gouge ran across. Thankfully, it hadn\'t impacted the filtering rune she had already etched into the surface. Narrowly missed it. She <em>scraped</em> the stone off the bottom of the channel.</p>\n<p>If she deepened the channel, it would minimize the essence flowing into the gouge across the surface. The best fix for it was to apply some paste made with ground-up essence stone into the gouge. That would effectively block the essence, but she didn\'t have any of that paste, and relying on it is a cheap fix for this.</p>\n<p>She\'s been doing this for seven years. Mistakes like this shouldn\'t be happening.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>Distantly, she noted the boat creaking as the lone dockloader climbed aboard with a metal box. She paused her efforts to give the girl a wave as she trundled across the deck towards the cabin.</p>\n<p>The issue with this solution to a gouge across a channel is that it permanently deepens the channels across the rest of the glyph. There already needs to be a steady lowering of depth to make sure the essence flowed the right direction. This made every other rune on the glyph after the lowering much more difficult, to her chagrin. Like glyphwork isn\'t challenging enough.</p>\n<p>She hadn\'t etched in the next runes for this glyph regardless. Once she finished deepening the channel, she set the glyph down and tilted her head up and away from it. She needed to get up and do <em>something</em> other than sit there.</p>\n<p>The first thing that came to mind was the dockloader on board. Sae\'s curiosity had been poking at her ever since she noticed her being given the governor\'s share of the work: finding out why she was still trying would kill two birds with one stone.</p>\n<p>Her body complained as she stood up and walked the short distance to the cabin. Sae listened, taking note of the major issues: sitting cross-legged on the deck had her legs complaining, her hand was cramping from the awkward positions required to etch the glyph, and her back renewed its complaints towards her for hunching over.</p>\n<p>Sae dismissed them all as best she could. Pain and aches were worth it.</p>\n<p>The cabin greeted her as an old friend as she walked in. The trapdoor to the storage compartment of the fishing boat was flipped open, resting against the Captain\'s chair and navigational table. Sae\'s desk was in here, though she didn\'t have a chair to go with it. She usually borrowed the Captain\'s.</p>\n<p>She turned away from her thoughts and towards the trapdoor. The girl inside was settling the box she carried against the wall, giving a deep sigh that Sae <em>heavily</em> empathized with. She stood there for a moment, watching the walls, before turning to climb up the ladder.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>The dockloader girl paused halfway up, her eyes trailing a line up Sae\'s pants, shirt, settling on her face.</p>\n<p>A silent moment passed between them. Sae wasn\'t going to start the conversation.</p>\n<p>...The moment extended. Dockloader girl\'s face scrunched up, her mouth forming an \'o\'. Her eyes still hadn\'t left Sae\'s face.</p>\n<p>Sae couldn\'t stand the <em>searching</em> expression on the girl\'s face, and broke the tense air with irritation in her voice. \"Why are you working alone?\"</p>\n<p>She crossed her arms, resolving not to offer anything further. She came here to sate her curiosity, not to badger someone with questions during their work hours.</p>\n<p>It took a moment, but <em>finally</em> the girl spoke. A light voice, tinged with exhaustion: \"My coworkers aren\'t pulling their weight.\" She paused, minutely. \"Believe me, I\'m going to the Docks rep after my shift.\"</p>\n<p>Sae weighed that as best she could, and formed a response in her head. \'<em>Do you want someone to come with you and back your claim?</em>\' was on the tip of her tongue before the girl continued. \"You guys probably need whatever\'s in these boxes too, right? Someone\'s gotta do it.\"</p>\n<p>Sae\'s previous thought fell out of her head at the sheer idiocy of what she just said. \"We do. But...\" she trailed off, then got her thoughts back in order. \"You do know you\'ve taken so long to load it that going to the Docks representative, talking to him for fifteen minutes, and bringing him back would\'ve taken less time than you\'ve spent interrupting me?\"</p>\n<p>Oh, <em>that</em> got under her skin. The dockloader girl flushed and sputtered out something, and looked away from he.</p>\n<p>It wasn\'t like she was trying to get to her, but it was plainly evident that just doing the job was not going to be enough. Why would the boss care who got the job done if it got done?</p>\n<p>\"Look! I\'m not gonna leave a bunch of boxes at the dock. Sorry it\'s interrupting whatever -\" The dockloader girl interrupted herself to punctuate her words with a wave. \"- you\'re doing, but I\'d like to finish it up so I can report my terrible colleagues and even worse manager. Can I climb up now?\"</p>\n<p>Satisfaction crept through her as the girl got more and more worked up through her speech, but it was doused in ice-cold water as soon as she asked to climb up. Sae had no idea she was blocking her. Embarrassment gripped her as she stepped back, masking it with cold indifference.</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" Her voice cracked on the \'oh\', and she hid her cringe. \"I didn\'t know I was blocking you.\"</p>\n<p>As the girl climbed up, Sae offered an apology. \"Not a problem,\" the dockloader waved it off. \"I\'ll see you in a second when I go and grab another ration box.\" She pushed the door open, and walked out like she was on fire.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, sure.\" was all she got out before the girl was gone. The silence returned, even more stifling without someone else to share it with.\n    <br>\n</p>','2024-11-03 14:50:17');
