<h2>What's a Backend?</h2>
<p>
    A backend is the part of a website you don't get to directly access; it handles requests that you make to any URL on the page. So, for instance, this page is titled "backend", and you access it through [url].org/backend. The server sees that and sends you this page.
</p>
<p>
    It can also handle queries; say I wanted to build a "comments" feature, where anyone can leave a comment on any post I make. I can set up a request handler on a backend for a specific URL, say [url].org/comment?name={name}&body={body}, and it can handle that request, store it, and then attach it to my page so everyone else can see it!
</p>
<h2>What I Used</h2>
<p>
    I previously used an Apache .htaccess file to control the way the site was presented; this had several disadvantages, namely:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I don't know Apache that well.</li>
    <li>It was cumbersome to adjust, and it didn't really work for what I had in mind.</li>
    <li>It wasn't set up to be a "true" backend; all I had was the .htaccess file, and the Apache documentation made my head spin.</li>
    <li>I couldn't find a good way to set up a testing environment for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Given, a lot of that would have been minimized by things like.. "learning" "Apache", but who's got the time for that in this economy? So, I swapped to a node.js backend, and <em>that's</em> handling all my requests.
</p>
<p>
    It honestly wasn't that hard to set up. Just get <span title="Yeah, I use ChatGPT, yuk it up. It's easy to write out boilerplate code with it.">ChatGPT to write a basic template</span>, optimize it, test it locally, then set it up on the web hosting service I use. Easy peasy.
</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Honestly, I'm not sure. I think I need to rewrite the backend to serve up the CSS and other static content better, and then <em>maybe</em> work on a comment system? It probably isn't too hard. Probably. Then write more posts.</p>
